</div>


<p>“La Cuisine Creole” (Creole cookery) partakes of
the nature of its birthplace—New Orleans—which is
cosmopolitan in its nature, blending the characteristics
of the American, French, Spanish, Italian, West Indian
and Mexican. In this compilation will be found many
original recipes and other valuable ones heretofore unpublished,
notably those of Gombo file, Bouille-abaisse,
Courtbouillon, Jambolaya, Salade a la Russe, Bisque of
Cray-fish a la Creole, Pusse Cafe, Cafe brule, Brulot,
together with many confections and delicacies for the
sick, including a number of mixed drinks. Much domestic
contentment depends upon the successful preparation
of the meal; and as food rendered indigestible
through ignorance in cooking often creates discord and
unhappiness, it behooves the young housekeeper to
learn the art of cooking.</p>

<p>It is the author’s endeavor to present to her a number
of recipes all thoroughly tested by experience, and embracing
the entire field of the “Cuisine,” set forth in
such clear, concise terms, as to be readily understood
and easily made practicable, thereby unveiling the
mysteries which surround her, upon the <i lang="fr">entree</i> into the
kitchen. Economy and simplicity govern “La Cuisine
Creole”; and its many savory dishes are rendered palatable
more as the result of care in their preparation than
any great skill or expensive outlay in the selection of
materials. The Creole housewife often makes delicious
<i lang="fr">morceaux</i> from the things usually thrown away by the
extravagant servant. She is proud of her art, and deservedly
receives the compliments of her friends. This
volume will be found quite different from the average
cook-book in its treatment of recipes, and is the only
one in print containing dishes peculiar to “la Cuisine
Creole.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOUP">SOUP</h2>


<p>Soup being the first course served at all ordinary dinners,
we make it the basis for preliminary remarks.
Nothing more palatable than good, well-made soup, and
nothing less appetising than poor soup. Now to attain
perfection in any line, care and attention are requisite,
careful study a necessity, and application the moving
force. Hence, cooking in all its branches should be
studied as a science, and not be looked upon as a haphazard
mode of getting through life. Cooking is in a
great measure a chemical process, and the ingredients
of certain dishes should be as carefully weighed and
tested as though emanating from the laboratory. Few
female cooks think of this, but men with their superior
instinctive reasoning power are more governed by law
and abide more closely to rule; therefore, are better
cooks, and command higher prices for services.</p>

<p>Now, with regard to soup making, the first care is to
have the fire brisk, the vessel in which it is cooked
thoroughly cleaned and free from odor. To insure this,
keep one vessel sacred to soup as nearly as possible; and
after serving wash the pot with potash water, or take a
piece of washing soda the size of a nutmeg, dissolve in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
hot water and then cleanse the vessel. A good workman
is known by his tools, so also a good cook will look well
to the utensils before commencing operations. Good
results follow carefulness.</p>

<p><em>Soup must have time</em> to cook, and should always boil
gently, that the meat may become tender, and give out
its juices. Allow a quart of water and a teaspoonful of
salt for each pound of meat. Soup meat must always be
put down in cold water. Skim well before it comes to
the boiling point, and again skim off superfluous fat before
putting in the vegetables. The vegetables most
used in soups are carrots, leeks, parsley, turnip, celery,
tomatoes, okras, cabbage, cauliflower, peas and potatoes.</p>

<p>One large leek, two carrots, one bunch of parsley, two
turnips and a potato, will be enough for one pot of soup.
One head of celery, two leeks, two turnips, and five or
six small potatoes will be enough another time. Six
tomatoes skinned, the juice strained from the seeds,
a leek, a bunch of parsley, and six potatoes will
answer for another style; a carrot, some cabbage, tomatoes,
and potatoes will do another time. Okra alone is
vegetable enough for a gombo, unless onion is liked with
it. Green peas, lettuce, and new potatoes are enough
for spring lamb soup. Vermicelli and macaroni are for
chicken, lamb or veal soup, with the addition of onion
if liked.</p>

<p>It is well to prepare the vegetables when the meat is
put over the fire to boil; allow a quart of water to a
pound of meat. Trim and scrape carrots, then cut or
grate them. Wash parsley and cut it small. Pare turnips
and cut them in slices a quarter of an inch thick.
Cut leeks in thick slices. Cut celery in half lengths; the
delicate green leaves give a fine flavor to the soup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
Pour boiling water on tomatoes, which will cause the
skins to peel off easily; when cool, squeeze out the
seeds, and reserve the juice for use in soup.</p>

<p>Shave cabbage in thin slices. Slice okra for gombo or
okra soup. Pare the potatoes, shell the peas, and cut
off green corn from the cob, for all these add fine flavor
to soup.</p>

<p>To color soup brown, use browned flour or a little
burnt sugar. Spinach leaves give a fine green color.
Pound the leaves, tie them in a cloth, and squeeze out
all the juice which add to the soup five minutes before
serving. This is also used to give color to mock-turtle
soup.</p>

<p>You may color soup red by putting in the strained
juice of tomatoes, or the whole tomato, if it is run
through a sieve; grated carrot gives a fine amber color;
okra gives a pale green.</p>

<p>For white soups, which are made of veal, lamb, and
chicken, white vegetables are best, such as rice, pearl
barley, vermicelli, and macaroni; the thickening should
then be made of unbrowned flour.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">STOCK FOR SOUP</span></p>

<p>Stock in its composition is not confined to any set
rules for any particular proportions. All cook books
give particular as well as general directions for
its manufacture; but all cooks know that the most
economical plan is to have a general stock-pot, where,
or into which, you can throw any pieces of beef or any
piece of meat from which gravy can be extracted—bones,
skin, brisket or tops of ribs, ox-cheek, ham, trimmings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
of turkey and other fowls, pieces of mutton, bacon,
veal, game, etc., etc. In fact, anything that will
become a jelly will assist in making stock. To this
medley of ingredients add pepper, salt, spices, herbs,
carrots cut small, onions, and curry, if wished, etc.,
and stew all to a rich consistency over a slow fire, and
then remove to cool. When cool, or rather cold, every
particle of fat must be removed and stock poured clear
of all sediment; it is now ready for use. When very rich
soup is desired, the jelly from a cow-heel, or lump of
butter rolled in flour, must be added to the stock.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO CLARIFY STOCKS OR SOUPS</span></p>

<p>The whites of two eggs to about four quarts of stock
or soup; two pints and a half of cold water.</p>

<p>Whisk the whites of two fresh eggs with half a pint of
water for ten minutes; then pour in very gently the four
quarts of boiling stock or soup, stirring it all the time.
Place the stewpan over the fire, and skim the mixture
till clear before allowing it to boil. When on the point
of boiling, stir rapidly; then place it a little back from
the fire, and let it settle till the whites of the eggs become
separated. Strain it through a fine cloth placed
over a sieve, and it will be clear and good.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">STOCK FOR GRAVIES</span></p>

<p>Cut the meat from a knuckle of veal, and put it, with
a pound of lean beef, into two quarts of water; add one
table-spoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper;
cover it close, and let it stew until the meat is very tender;
then strain it and keep it for rich soups or gravies,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
as thinning them with water spoils them. Always keep
a pot or stewpan in which to throw all nice pieces of
meat left from dinner, also any steak, bones, chicken
wings, etc., etc. This makes a reserve of stock with
very little fresh meat. It is useful and economical, and,
being without vegetables, never sours. In making oyster
soup use a pint or so of this stock to the usual quart
of oysters and a pint of milk.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PLAIN BEEF SOUP</span></p>

<p>Five pounds of the leg or shin of beef; one gallon of
water; a teaspoonful of salt; two heads of celery; five
carrots; three onions; four turnips; two tomatoes, and
a bunch of sweet herbs. Boil four hours and a half.</p>

<p>Cut the meat in two or three pieces, and put them
into a pot with a gallon of cold water, which gradually
soaks out the juices of the meat before coming to the
boil. Salt well, then skim as the soup heats. Boil
slowly with a regular heat for about four hours; then
add two heads of celery, five carrots cut small, two tomatoes,
three onions sliced and fried, and the sweet
herbs tied up in muslin. The turnips should be added
half an hour before serving. If any portion of the meat
is required for the table, take it from the soup about
two hours before dinner. Let the remainder be left in
the soup, which must be strained through a hair sieve
before it is served.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SOUP ET BOUILLI</span></p>

<p>Six or eight pounds of a brisket of beef; three carrots;
four turnips; two onions; six cloves; two heads
of celery; one clove of garlic; a bunch of sweet herbs; a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
little salt; a piece of butter; a little flour; one French
roll; a tablespoonful of French mustard.</p>

<p>Put the beef into a pot and cover it with water, and
when it boils take off the scum as it rises; then draw it
to the side of the fire to stew slowly for five or six
hours, with the carrots, turnips, celery, garlic, bunch of
sweet herbs, and the onions stuck with cloves. When
done lay the bouilli on a hot dish, and strew over it
some carrots, turnips and the stalks of celery, previously
boiled and cut into shapes. Add to it a sauce made
of a little of the soup, thickened with flour fried in butter,
and seasoned with pepper and salt. Strain the
soup over a French roll placed at the bottom of the
tureen and serve. The bouilli may have a spoonful of
French mustard added to the soup sauce.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BROTH IN HASTE</span></p>

<p>Cut some rare roast meat or broiled steak very fine.
To a teacupful of the cut meat put a pint and a half
of boiling water; cover it, and set it on the fire for ten
minutes; season to taste. Roll a cracker fine, and put
in with the meat. This broth is both excellent and
convenient for invalids or children.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PLAIN CHICKEN-BROTH FOR AN INVALID</span></p>

<p>Cut a young fowl into four parts, wash well in cold
water, put the pieces in a stewpan with one quart of
cold water and a little salt; let it boil gently, skim it
well; add the white heart of a head of lettuce and a
handful of chervil. Boil the broth for an hour, then
strain it into a bowl. Two tablespoonfuls of pearl barley
added to the broth when first put on makes it quite
nourishing for an invalid.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">CRAYFISH-BROTH FOR PURIFYING THE BLOOD</span></p>

<p>Take two pounds of the lean part of very white veal,
chop it very fine; add to it three dozen crayfish and a
handful of green chervil; pound them together to
thoroughly bruise the crayfish; then put the whole into
a stewpan, and pour upon it three pints of cold spring
water; add a little salt, and place the stewpan on the
stove to boil. After half an hour, set it back on the
stove, and let it simmer very gently for an hour, then
strain. It should be taken fasting to insure its best
effect.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SOUPE MAIGRE, WITHOUT MEAT, FOR LENT</span></p>

<p>Melt half a pound of butter in a stewpan, put in six
onions sliced; add two heads of celery cut small, one-half
a head of white cabbage, and a bunch of chopped
parsley; let them boil twenty minutes, then stir in three
rolled crackers; pour in two quarts of boiling milk, or
milk and water; let this boil up gently for half an hour,
and just before serving stir in two well-beaten eggs.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHICKEN SOUP. YELLOW AND VERY RICH</span></p>

<p>Take two pounds of veal, half as much beef or lamb,
and one small chicken cut up; boil them in three quarts
of water, skim off all the scum as it rises; slice a leek or
two onions, grate a large carrot or two small ones; put
all these to the soup; add two tablespoonfuls of salt
and one of pepper. Let it boil gently for two hours,
then add a spoonful of butter worked in flour; cover
this for fifteen minutes, and serve in a tureen. Take the
chicken into a deep dish, put over it butter, pepper, and
sprigs of parsley; or you may chop the chicken up,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
season with pepper, salt, butter, and an egg; form into
balls, roll them in flour, and drop them in a few minutes
before serving.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">VEAL GRAVY SOUP</span></p>

<p>Throw into a stewpan one pound veal cutlet, three
slices of ham, two tablespoonfuls of lard, and let them
fry gently; then, before browning, add three sliced
onions, two carrots, two parsnips, a head of celery, and
a few cloves. Let them cook slowly till lightly browned,
then add a pint and a half of boiling broth or water; let
this cook for an hour, and then put in a cup of mushrooms;
skim and strain for use.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SCOTCH BARLEY BROTH. CHEAP AND SUBSTANTIAL</span></p>

<p>Wash half a pound of Scotch barley in cold water;
put it in a pot with four or five pounds of shin beef
sawed into small pieces, cover it with cold water and
set it on the fire. When it boils skim it well, and then
add three onions. Set it near the fire to simmer gently
for two hours. If much fat rises skim again; then add
two heads of celery and a couple of turnips cut into thin
pieces. Season with salt, and let it boil for an hour and
a half. Take out the meat on a platter and cover to
keep warm; then pour the soup in a tureen and serve.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CONSOMME OF BEEF AND FOWL</span></p>

<p>Take two pounds of lean beef and a fowl half roasted
and cut in pieces, put into a saucepan, which must be
filled with stock or plain broth; skim it well, salt it to
taste, and add two carrots, two onions, a head of celery
or a pinch of celery seed, also a little thyme, a whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
pepper, mace, and a bay leaf. Let it simmer gently for
three or four hours, then strain through a coarse cloth;
free it entirely from fat, and clarify it with the white of
an egg.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">WHITE CONSOMME OF FOWL</span></p>

<p>Take one or two fowls, old or young. Let them lie
half an hour in cold water to cleanse from the blood,
then drain and put them in a pot; fill it with water, let
it boil, then skim it. Add one large carrot, or two small
ones, two turnips, one onion, one head of celery, two
cloves, a piece of mace, a little salt. Let it boil gently
for two hours if the chickens are young; if old, three
hours. When they are tender, skim off the fat, and pass
the consomme through a sieve. This consomme may
be considered a basis for all white soups, as well as
white sauces, and should be used instead of water for
filling them up.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PLAIN VERMICELLI SOUP, NO. 1</span></p>

<p>Put a soup-bone, weighing from two to three pounds,
or a brisket of beef, into four quarts of water; add two
onions, two carrots, and two turnips; salt to taste, and
place over the fire to boil for three hours; then remove
and strain; put back on the stove, and add a quarter of
a pound of vermicelli, and let it boil till tender; serve
with tomatoes.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">VERMICELLI SOUP, NO. 2</span></p>

<p>Cut about four pounds of knuckle of veal, one pound
and a half of the scrag of mutton, and a few slices of
ham into small pieces; put them into a saucepan with
one onion stuck with cloves, and four ounces of butter;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>

<p>This is a most excellent form of soup, and is an economical
way of using up the remains of any cold roasted
chicken, turkey, game, or other meats. Cut up and
season the chicken, meat, or other material to make
the soup; fry to a light brown in a pot, and add boiling
water in proportion to your meat. Two pounds of meat
or chicken (bones and all), with a half pound of ham,
or less of breakfast-bacon, will flavor a gallon of soup,
which, when boiled down, will make gombo
for six people. When the boiling water is added to the meat, let it
simmer for at least two hours. Take the large bones
from the pot, and add okra or a preparation of dried
and pounded sassafras leaves, called filee. This makes
the difference in gombo. For gombo for six people use
one quart of sliced okra; if filee be used, put in a coffeecupful.
Either gives the smoothness so desirable in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
this soup. Oysters, crabs, and shrimp may be added
when in season, as all improve the gombo. Never strain
gombo. Add green corn, tomatoes, etc., etc., if desired.
Serve gombo with plain-boiled rice.</p>

desired; cut into this four dozen small okra pods, one
large onion, a little red pepper, and salt to taste. Let all
simmer on a slow fire for about twenty minutes; then
fill up with warm water, enough to cover the contents
two inches deep. Let this boil for two hours. If it becomes

<p>Split the mackerel down the back; season with pepper

over a moderate fire and, when browned on one side,
turn. If it is a very large fish, divide it and broil one
half at a time. When done, place it on a dish, and put
butter, parsley and lemon juice over it. Serve with

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">FLOUNDERS AND MULLETS FRIED</span></p>

<p>These fish are very fine when fresh from the waters
of Lake Pontchartrain. Flounder is better broiled, but
still is very nice fried. Clean and dry the fish. Do not
cut them in pieces, but score them across if very large.
Have lard or bacon fat very hot; roll the fish in flour
and drop into the boiling fat. Let them cook until
brown, and serve with sauce No. 15.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PLAIN BOILED RED FISH OR RED SNAPPER</span></p>

<p>Wash the fish; when cleaned, wipe it dry and rub it
over with lemon juice and salt. Put it in a fish kettle
or other vessel to boil, cover it with soft water and
throw in a handful of salt. As soon as it begins to boil,
skim it and let it simmer; hard boiling breaks the flesh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
before it is cooked thoroughly. When done, lift it out
of the water with a drainer, slip it carefully on a dish
and send to table with sauces No. 13 and No. 3.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">RED-FISH A LA PROVENCALE</span></p>

<p>Have properly cleaned a medium sized fish; score it
deep then put in a large dish and cover with a pickle or
marinade made of two sliced carrots, two onions, some
parsley and bay-leaves, three cloves of garlic, pepper
and salt, the juice of two lemons, and a gill of salad
oil. When thoroughly flavored, remove the fish from
the marinade and bake three-quarters of an hour, basting
frequently with wine and butter. When done, put
it on a platter and keep hot. Add half a bottle of wine
and some cayenne pepper to the marinade; stew well
and strain over the fish. Garnish with cut lemon,
sprigs of parsley and capers.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BAKED AND STEWED CODFISH</span></p>

<p>Scald for ten minutes some soaked codfish, it should
soak all night; then scrape it white, pick it in flakes,
and put it in a stewpan with a tablespoonful of nice
butter worked into as much flour, and milk enough to
moisten it. Let it stew gently ten minutes; add pepper
to taste, and serve hot. Slice hard-boiled eggs over it,
and sprigs of parsley around the dish.</p>

<p>If the fish is to be baked you must put it on to scald,
as above, after soaking all night; you must then put on
double as much Irish potatoes as the quantity of codfish.
Boil them, mash them, and then pick up the codfish
fine, seasoning it with butter and pepper; moisten
it with two beaten eggs, a little chopped onion, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
milk if necessary. Make it all into a large soft pat, or
cake, smooth it with a knife blade and put it in the
stove to be browned lightly.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CODFISH CAKES</span></p>

<p>Soak the codfish all night, then scald for ten minutes;
put to it an equal quantity of potatoes boiled and
mashed; moisten it with beaten eggs, a bit of butter and
a little pepper; form it into round cakes, about half an
inch thick, roll them each one in flour, and fry in hot
lard until they are a delicate brown. The lard must be
boiling, and the cakes fried gently.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">COD AU BEURRE ROUX</span></p>

<p>Cod; a little browned butter; a little flour; sugar;

<p>For cod au beurre roux, boil a piece of cod and separate
it into flakes; brown some butter, dredge in a little
flour, and a little sugar in powder, and in this fry
some slices of onion a fine brown; throw in the vinegar,
boil it up, pour over the fish, and serve it with crisp
parsley.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">OYSTER STUFFING FOR TURKEY</span></p>

<p>Take three or four dozen nice plump oysters, wash
and beard them, add to them a tumblerful of bread
crumbs; chop up a tumblerful of nice beef suet; mix together,
and moisten with three eggs; season with salt,
pepper, a little butter, a teaspoonful of mace, and some
cayenne pepper. Roll force-meat into cakes, and fry
them. They are pretty laid around a turkey or
chicken.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">OYSTERS STEWED WITH CHAMPAGNE</span></p>

<p>Put into a silver chafing dish a quarter of a pound
of butter; lay in a quart of oysters; strew over them
grated bread which has been toasted, beaten and sifted,
some cut parsley and a little pepper and salt; cover the
top with bits of butter cut thin; pour on a pint of
champagne, cover and cook. This may be done in a pan
or oven.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">OYSTERS STEWED WITH MILK</span></p>

<p>Take a pint of fine oysters, one-half pint of their own
liquor and a half a pint of milk; boil the liquor, take
off the scum; put in a quarter of a pound of butter,
pepper and salt to taste, and serve crackers and
dressed celery with them.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">STEWED OYSTERS ON TOAST</span></p>

<p>Take the oysters from their liquor, let it settle; then
strain and add some whole pepper, two blades of mace,
and three cloves, and put over a moderate fire in a
block-tin covered sauce-pan; mix a little flour with a
piece of butter, as large as a hen’s egg for two dozen
oysters, and stir in the boiling liquor; remove any
scum which may rise, then put in the oysters and let
them cook for five minutes. Line a hot oyster dish
with toasted, well-buttered bread, and pour over it the
boiling oysters. Only rich juicy oysters will stew to
advantage. Milk is always an improvement, but in
this recipe it can be dispensed with; if, however, it
is convenient pour in a half a pint just as the oysters
are put in to boil, as earlier it might curdle.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">OYSTER TOAST</span></p>

<p>A nice little dish for a luncheon or a late supper.
Scald a quart of oysters in their own liquor, take them

out and pound or chop them to a paste; add a little
cream or fresh butter, and some pepper and salt. Get
ready some thin slices of toast moistened with boiling
water, and spread with fresh butter; then, spread over
the butter the oyster paste. Put a thin slice of fresh
cut lemon on each piece, and lay parsley on the platter.
Serve this very hot or it will not be good.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SCALLOPED OYSTERS.—NO. 1</span></p>

<p>Lay the oysters in a shallow pan or dish with a little
of their own liquor, some pepper, salt, chopped parsley,
butter, and grated bread crumbs. Have a layer of bread
crumbs on the top of the pan, and set it in the oven to
bake a light brown. They should be served hot with
tomato or walnut catsup poured over them.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SCALLOPED OYSTERS.—NO. 2</span></p>

<p>Procure any quantity of oysters desired, and place in
a baking dish; put alternate layers of oysters and
pounded crackers; season each layer with salt, pepper

the crackers, and bake forty minutes. Serve hot.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">OYSTERS FRIED</span></p>

<p>Take large oysters from their own liquor; dry and
lay them in a towel till you heat, very hot, a cup of lard
in a thick-bottomed pan. Dip each oyster in wheat
flour, or rolled cracker, until it will hold no more; then
lay it in the pan. The fire must be moderate, or the
oysters will scorch before cooking through. They will
brown on one side in five minutes, then turn them.
Oysters may be dipped in beaten egg and rolled cracker,
and then fried.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">OYSTER PICKLE. VERY EASY AND NICE</span></p>

<p>Wash four dozen oysters; let them be fine and large,
with plenty of their own liquor. Pick them carefully,
strain their liquor and to it add a dessertspoonful of
pepper, two blades of mace, a tablespoonful of salt, and
a cup of strong wine vinegar. Simmer the oysters in
this five minutes, then put them in small jars. Boil the
pickle again, and when cold add a cup of fresh vinegar;
and fill up the jars, cork them, and set away for use.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">VEAL SWEETBREAD AND OYSTER PIE</span></p>

<p>The sweetbread of veal is the most delicate part of
the animal. Boil it tender, season with pepper, salt and
butter; put in two dozen oysters; thicken their juice
with a cup of cream, a tablespoonful of butter, the yolks
of two hard-boiled eggs, and a tablespoonful of flour.
Pour all in a deep pan, and cover with paste and bake.
If there is too much liquid, keep it to serve with the
pie, if necessary, when baked. After baking, the pie is
sometimes too dry.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BEEFSTEAK AND OYSTER PIE</span></p>

<p>Cut three pounds of lean beefsteak. Salt, pepper and
fry quickly so as to brown without cooking through;
then place in a deep dish. Get four dozen oysters,
beard them, and lay them in the pan over the beef; season
with salt and pepper. Take the gravy in which the
steaks were fried, pour out some of the grease; dredge
in a tablespoonful of flour, let it brown and add to it a
pint of good beef broth, then put in a wine-glassful
of mushroom catsup, some of Harvey’s or Worcestershire
sauce; heat it, and let it boil up a few times, then
pour it over the oysters and steak. When the gravy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
has become cool, cover the pie with a good puff paste,
and bake it for an hour and a half.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">FRICASSEE OF CRABS</span></p>

<p>Take six nice fat crabs, wash them, and while <em>alive</em>
chop off the claws; then clean the rest of the crabs
carefully and lay them in a dish. Chop up two onions
fine, fry them in a tablespoonful of butter and lard
mixed; when brown and soft stir in a large spoonful of
flour, which must also brown nicely; throw in some
chopped parsley and a little green onion, and when they
are cooked pour on a quart of boiling water—this is
the gravy. Now put in the crabs without parboiling.
Let them simmer in the gravy for half an hour, and
serve with boiled rice. Parboiling crabs destroys their
flavor; they should be alive to the last moment.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SOFT-SHELLED CRABS, FRIED</span></p>

<p>Clean the crabs properly, dip them into rolled
cracker, and fry them in hot lard salted. They must
be dried carefully before frying, or they will not brown
well. Serve with any favorite sauce.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO DRESS A TURTLE</span></p>

<p>Cut off the head and let it bleed well. Separate the
bottom shell from the top with care, for fear of breaking
the gall bag. Throw the liver and eggs, if any, into
a bowl of water. Slice off all the meat from the under-shell
and put in water also; break the shell in pieces,
wash carefully and place it in a pot; cover it with
water, and add one pound of middling or flitch of
bacon with four chopped onions. Set this on the fire to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
boil. (If preferred, open and clean the chitterlings or
intestines also—some use them.) Let this boil gently
for four hours; keep the liver to fry. While the under-shell
is boiling, wash the top-shell neatly, cut all the
meat out, cover it up and set it by. Parboil the fins,
clean them perfectly; take off the black skin and throw
them into water. Now cut the flesh removed from both
shells into small pieces; cut the fins up; sprinkle with
salt, cover and set them by. When the pot containing
the shells, etc., has boiled four hours, take out the
bacon, scrape the shell, clean and strain the liquor,
pour back in the pot about one quart, and put the rest
by for the soup (Turtle Soup No. 2). Pick out the nice
pieces strained out, and put with the fins in the gravy.
Add to the meat one bottle of wine, one gill mushroom
catsup, one gill of lemon pickle, cloves, nutmeg, salt,
pepper, and one pound fresh butter rolled in flour.
Stew together; take out the herbs, thicken with flour
and put in the shell to bake with a puff paste around
it. Trim with eggs.</p>

or two hours, after which throw them into scalding
water, and remove the skin without tearing the flesh.
Wipe them dry, dust flour on them and fry in butter or
sweet oil, with plenty of chopped parsley. When brown,
dust pepper and a little salt over them, and garnish
with crisped parsley. Stewed frogs are seasoned with
butter, wine, beaten eggs and parsley chopped fine.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">TERRAPIN</span></p>

<p>Like crabs and lobsters, terrapins are thrown alive
into boiling water and let boil till the outer shell and
toe-nails can be removed. Then wash and boil them
in salted water till the fleshy part of the leg is tender.
Put them in a bowl or deep dish, take off the second
shell, remove the sand bag and gall bladder, and cut off
the spongy part. Cut up the meat, season it with salt,
pepper, cayenne and mace, thicken with butter and
flour, and cook. Just before serving put in a gill of
sherry wine for every terrapin, and pour all over hot
buttered toast.

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO SERVE MEAT OR CHICKEN PIE</span></p>

<p>Lay a fringed napkin in a waiter or plate larger than

turn up the edges of the napkin against it, and put
sprigs of parsley or delicate green leaves of celery on
the edge of the plate to keep the napkin in place.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">A NICE WAY TO SERVE COLD MEAT</span></p>

<p>Cut cold roast beef in slices, put gravy enough to

If there is not enough gravy, make more by putting hot
water and a good bit of butter, with a spoonful of
browned flour. Let it stew gently. If liked, a sliced
leek with a bunch of parsley may be added. Serve
mashed potatoes with it. This is equal to beef a la

herbs, and vegetables, the same as for soup; keep it
boiling till it is reduced to a quart, then strain through

<p>Many persons like truffles for stuffing for a roast
pig; they should be mixed with fat bacon, livers of veal
or fowl, sweet herbs, pepper, salt and butter. Chestnut
stuffing is prepared by roasting sixty chestnuts.
Remove their hulls while hot, and pound them fine,
add four ounces of butter, run this through a sieve,
and add to it a few green onions, or chives, sweet basil,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
parsley and thyme; grate in a nutmeg, put in pepper

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LIVER AND TRUFFLE STUFFING FOR A PIG OR TURKEY</span></p>

<p>Pare and cut into small pieces a pound of truffles, put

one-half pound of fat bacon, chopped very fine; add a
spoonful of black pepper, a clove of garlic, a little salt,
a bunch of sweet basil and thyme, dried and powdered;
add also half a pound of nice veal liver, boiled and
grated. Set this all on the fire, let it cook until the
truffles are soft, then mash with a wooden spoon; take
it off to cool it, and stuff the pig with the forcemeat.
Baste the pig with sweet oil, which is better than butter.
It is supposed the pig comes from the butchers all
ready for stuffing and baking. If the stuffing is desired
for a turkey, add a quarter of a pound of bread crumbs
and two beaten eggs, and baste the turkey with butter,
instead of oil.</p>

garlic; pound or chop this very fine (it is well, and
saves trouble, to run it through a sausage chopper),
and make it in a paste with two raw eggs, some butter,
marrow or drippings; stuff your joint, or poultry,
and if there is some not used, roll it round the balls,
flour them and fry in boiling lard. This is a nice garnish

yolk of egg, and sprinkle over it fine cracker crumbs.
Bake half an hour, and serve with gravy made from
the bones, etc., of the veal. Serve the gravy hot.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">MINCED VEAL AND POACHED EGGS</span></p>

<p>One pound of cold veal chopped very fine. Boil half
a pint of sauce till it begins to thicken or glaze; then
add a cup of cream and the minced veal; season with
pepper and salt. When dished put six poached eggs
around it, alternately with slices of red tongue or ham.
This is a nice breakfast dish, and uses to advantage the
cold meats from the day previous.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CALVES’ AND PIGS’ FEET FRIED IN BATTER</span></p>

<p>Wash and cook the feet tender, the day before using.
When wanted, wash and roll them in a little flour to dry.
Set them by, and make a batter of flour, eggs, milk, and
a little salt and pepper (one egg is sufficient to two
feet); take out the largest bones and roll the feet in batter,
or lay them in a pan with hot lard, and pour the batter
over them. Fry a delicate brown and serve on toast.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CALF’S HEAD BOILED OR BAKED</span></p>

<p>Have a head nicely cleaned, and soak it in salt and
water to make it look white. Remove the eyes. Take
out the tongue and salt it. Of the brains make a separate
dish. To boil the head put it in a pot of lukewarm
water and boil till very tender. Serve with sauce made
of butter, flour and water, some lemon juice and tomatoes.
If to bake, dredge flour over it, put on bits of
butter, season with pepper, salt, and sweet herbs, set
in a hot oven and baste with the water in which it was
boiled.</p>

bones and chop the meat and tendons very fine; strain
the liquor they were boiled in, and set it away to cool;
skim off the fat and pour the jelly over the meat.
Season with a teaspoonful of black pepper, salt, and
thyme, powdered; boil all together for a few minutes,
and pour into bowls or jelly moulds. Serve with parsley.
Add a little garlic if the flavor is liked.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">COLLARED CALF’S HEAD WITH BRAINS. COLD DISH</span></p>

<p>Boil half, or the whole calf’s head, as you require.
Cover it with water and let it simmer for two hours;
take it up, remove the bones, and put them back into
the broth; let it continue to stew, adding to it sage
leaves, and an onion. Cut the meat of head and brains
into a stew-pan, adding to it some slices of ham, pepper
and salt, the chopped tongue and an eschalot; let these
cook two hours. The brains should be beaten up with
two eggs, before putting them in, which should be the
last thing. Then pour all in a mould and fill up with
the liquor from the head, which should be boiled to a
jelly.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CURRY OF COLD ROAST FOWL</span></p>

<p>Take two large onions, two apples, two ounces of butter,
a dessertspoonful of curry powder or paste, half
pint of gravy or soup-stock, one spoonful of lemon juice
and two tomatoes.</p>

<p>Fry the fowl and the onions in butter to a light brown
color; stew the apples, or fry them also. Put all,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
onions, apples, gravy and fowl, with the tomatoes and
lemon juice into a stewing pan and let it stew thirty

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">WINTER DISH OF BAKED BEANS AND PORK</span></p>

<p>This is a very heavy dish, but nourishing, and it is
well to know how to cook it, as it is economical.</p>

<p>Pick the beans, wash them, and put them to soak over
night in plenty of water. In the morning pour this
water off and put the beans in a kettle of cold water;
place them on the fire and let them simmer till quite
tender. Take them up and drain them; when thoroughly
drained, put them in a baking pan with a large
piece of salt pork; score the pork and lay it deep in
among the beans, not upon them. Pour boiling water
over them and bake till brown. If in a range, leave
them in all night. This constant change of water improves
the beans very much, and makes them less
flatulent.

</div>
<hr class="medium">

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">REMARKS ON BOILING MEATS</span></p>

<p>Meat, whether fresh or salted, smoked or dried,
should always be put on the fire in cold water. Dried
meats should be soaked before boiling. The delicacy
of meat and fowls is preserved by carefully skimming
while they are boiling.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">STUFFED HAM</span></p>

<p>Smoked hams are much liked stuffed with spices and
sweet herbs, which the only kind of stuffing a salt ham
will admit, as bread, crackers or oysters would sour
before the ham could be used. If you wish to stuff a
ham, look at the recipe for “Aromatic Spices for
seasoning Meat, Pies, etc.” Soak your ham all night,
scrape it nicely, and boil it half an hour to make the
skin tender; then take it from the pot, gash it all over,
introduce as much of the pounded spices as the incisions
will hold, and then close the skin over the gashes and
boil in the same manner, with vegetables thrown in, as
in recipe for boiled ham.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BAKED HAM</span></p>

<p>Soak and clean your ham, boil it with onions, cloves,
parsley and sweet herbs until it is nearly done, then let
it cool in its own liquor; when cold, pull off the skin and
place the ham in the oven gate, with a little sugar and
bread crumbs over it till it is brown. If it is to be eaten
hot, serve with vegetables and some acid or piquant
sauce; if cold, send up savory jelly, No. 21.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">TO BOIL A HAM</span></p>

<p>Run a knife, or skewer, into the thickest part of the
ham next the bone; if the knife comes out clean the ham
is good, if it smells rank and smears the knife the ham
is not good. Select your ham, then, according to this
rule, and when good lay it in cold water; scrape and
wash it carefully, and let it remain in the water all
night. In the morning, when the water—enough to
cover the ham—is nearly boiling lay the ham in, and
keep the water in a simmer. When it has boiled about
an hour throw in two carrots, four onions, two heads of
celery, a sprig of parsley, two or three blades of mace
and four cloves. If the ham is very <a id="chg4"></a>salty, it is well to
change the water before putting in the seasoning. To
obtain tenderness and mellowness the ham must not be
allowed to boil hard, only simmer. Too much heat
hardens all meat, especially salt meat. When the ham
is done set it off in its own water, let it cool in it; by
this means it will retain its moisture. When cool take
it out, skin it, and dredge sugar over it, set it in the
oven till it browns, or hold a hot shovel over it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">DAUBE GLACEE OF BEEF, FOR COLD SUPPERS</span></p>

<p>Take a thick round of beef—from four to six inches
is the best size—make holes in it and stuff them with
salted pork or bacon; roll each piece, before it is drawn
through the beef, in pepper, salt, sugar, and vinegar,
with minced parsley, and a very little minced garlic.
If the weather is cold it will be better to keep the meat
till the next day before cooking it. Boil two calf’s feet
or four pig’s feet until they drop to pieces; pick out the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
bones and strain the liquor; set it away to jelly, or put
it on ice to make it jelly. The next morning, put one
half the jelly in a large stew pan, then add the beef, and
cover it with the remainder of the jelly. Paste the pan
over very tight or cover it extremely well, so that none
of the flavor can escape. Cook this about four hours;
when done, take out, cover with the liquor, and set it
aside till it is jellied. This is delicious to eat cold, for
suppers and collations.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BOILED BRISKET OF BEEF, STUFFED</span></p>

<p>A piece weighing about eight pounds requires five
or six hours to boil. Before boiling the beef make a
dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, butter, salt, sweet
herbs, mace, and an onion, all chopped fine and mixed
with a beaten egg. Put the dressing between the fat
and the lean of the beef; sew it up to keep the dressing
in. Flour a cloth, tie the beef up tight in it, and let it
boil five or six hours.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ROUND OF BEEF STEWED BROWN</span></p>

<p>Make incisions in the beef and stuff with chopped
onions, salt, pepper, and sweet basil, thyme and parsley.
Dredge the meat with flour, lay some slices of
bacon over it, and put it to brown in a close oven. Slice
two turnips, four carrots, four salsifies, three stalks of
celery and two onions; add a quarter of a cup of tomato
catsup or two large tomatoes; season with salt and put
all in the oven to cook with the meat. After it has
been cooking in the oven two hours and is brown, add
a cup of water with the vegetables. Cover again
closely, and let this stew for one or two hours more, or
until the meat and vegetables are tender.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">TO FRY A STEAK TO TASTE AS IF BROILED</span></p>

<p>It sometimes happens that when the fire is low and
the coals gone out, you are called on to cook a steak.
Then get up a quick blaze in the stove with some kindlings.
Put in a pan, over the blaze, a little butter; when
it is hot lay in your steak; let it fry quickly; while frying
cover the pan. Work some butter, salt and pepper
together in a tin pan, and when the steak is done to
taste, let it lie in this mixture a few minutes, and then
serve. Do not salt a steak until it is cooked as salt
will toughen it and draw out its juices.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ROUND OF BEEF A LA BARONNE</span></p>

<p>Boil a fat round of beef for half an hour, take it up
and put in a deep dish; cut gashes in the sides of the
meat, put pepper and salt into each gash; fill the dish
the meat is in with claret wine; set it in to bake, adding
as it goes in the stove three blades of mace, a cup of
pickled capers, or nasturtiums, three white onions cut
small, and a bunch of parsley cut fine. Stew or bake
all together until the meat is tender. Toast some slices
of bread very brown, lay them in the bottom of a dish,
lay in the beef and pour the gravy around it, unless it
is preferred in a sauce boat.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ROASTED BEEFSTEAKS</span></p>

<p>Tenderloin or porterhouse steaks are the best for
broiling. Have a clear fire of coals to broil on; rub the
gridiron with a little fat of the meat; lay on the steak
without salting, let it broil gently until one side is done,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
then turn. Catch the blood as you turn it, to make the
gravy rich. If the steak is a large firm one, take a
quarter of a pound of butter and work into it pepper
and salt. When the steak is done lay it on to this seasoned
butter, keep it hot until the butter melts, turn the
steak in it a few times, put the blood with the gravy,
and serve hot, with tomato sauce or catsup.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO ROAST BEEF IN A STOVE</span></p>

<p>A fine roasting piece of beef may, if properly managed,
be baked in a stove so as to resemble beef roasted
before a large, open fire. Prepare the meat as if for
roasting, season it well with salt, pepper, and a little
onion if liked. Set the meat on muffin rings, or a trivet
in a dripping pan, and pour into the pan a pint or so
of hot water to baste the meat with. Keep the oven hot
and well closed on the meat; when it begins to bake,
baste it freely, using a long-handled spoon; it should be
basted every fifteen minutes; add hot water to the pan
as it wastes, that the gravy may not burn; allow fifteen
minutes to each pound of meat unless you wish it very
rare. Half an hour before taking it up, dredge flour
thickly over it, baste freely and let it brown. Take the
meat from the pan, dredge in some flour and seasoning
if needed; throw into the gravy a cup of water, let it
boil up once, and strain into a sauce boat or gravy
tureen.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LEG OF MUTTON BOILED A L’ANGLAISE</span></p>

<p>Select a fat, fine leg of mutton, put it on the fire in
warm water; when it boils skim it, and let it simmer
gently for two hours and a half; throw in a tablespoonful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
of salt. When the mutton is done garnish with
turnips mashed in cream, butter, pepper and salt, and
send it to table with a sauce boat of caper sauce No. 11.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ROAST LEG OF MUTTON</span></p>

<p>Select a fine, fat leg, cut holes in it, and lard it with
fat bacon; season with parsley, pepper, and salt and
put it to bake in a slow oven. Roast it for two hours,
and serve with tomato sauce.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MUTTON STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS</span></p>

<p>Chop up half a pint of mushrooms, put them in a
stew pan with some chopped parsley and onion, and a
tablespoonful of grated lean and same of fat ham;
season with salt and pepper, add the yolks of four
eggs, stir it all together, and introduce it in the leg by
taking out the bone or by making incisions in the mutton.
Bake very brown, froth it up by dusting flour
over it, and serve with a good brown gravy, in which
some currant jelly is melted. Sauce No. 28 is very nice
for stuffed leg of mutton.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MUTTON HAUNCH</span></p>

<p>Let it lie in vinegar and water a few hours before it
is put to cook. When wanted, rub it all over with pepper
and salt, and when going to put it in the oven, cover
it with a paste made of flour and water, to keep in the
juices while baking; allow fifteen minutes to each
pound of mutton. When half done, take off the flour
paste, baste the meat well and dredge flour over it.
Half an hour before serving, stir into the pan a quarter
of a pound of butter, baste the meat freely, dredge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
flour over it again, and brown. Serve with port wine
and jelly in the gravy, or if preferred, use one of the
sauces mentioned for roast mutton.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MUTTON THAT WILL TASTE LIKE VENISON</span></p>

<p>Take a hind quarter of lamb or mutton; rub it well
all over with brown sugar, half a pint of wine, and
same of vinegar. Let it stay in this pickle for a day
or two, if the weather is cold. When it is wanted, wash
it, dry it, and roast it, or it may be cut into steaks, or
made into a pie like venison. Sugar is a great preservative,
and gives a finer flavor than salt, which
hardens delicate meats. Salt drains out the juices of
mutton or lamb.

<p>After the chickens are cleaned and trussed fold them
in a nice white cloth, put them in a large stew-pan and
cover them with boiling water; boil them gently, and
skim carefully as long as any scum rises; let them simmer
slowly as that will make them plump and white,
while fast boiling will make them dark and lose flavor.
When done lay them on a hot dish, and pour celery,
oyster, or egg sauce over them. Serve some also in a
boat, as it keeps hot longer than when poured over the
fowls. Boiled tongue or ham should be served with
boiled chicken. If the chicken is not very tough, an
hour or an hour and a quarter is sufficient to boil it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">COUNTRY FRIED CHICKENS</span></p>

<p>Take a young, fat chicken, cut it up, pepper and salt
it, dredge it over with flour, and set it by while you
mix a cup of lard, and some slices of fat bacon in a frying
pan. Let the lard get very hot, then drop in a few
pieces of the chicken, always allowing room in the pan
for each piece to be turned without crowding. As fast
as you fry the pieces, put them on a dish over hot water
to keep the heat in them while you make the gravy.
Pour off some of the grease the chicken was fried in,
and then dredge into the frying pan some flour, let this
brown nicely and then pour into it a cup of sweet milk,
little at a time; let it froth up, and then place your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
chicken back into the gravy for three minutes. If you
like the chicken brown and dry, pour the gravy under
it on the dish for serving.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BOILED CHICKENS WITH STUFFING</span></p>

<p>Truss and stuff the chicken as for roasting, dredge it
all over with wheat flour, and put it in a pot of boiling
water; take the pot off the fire for five minutes after
the chicken is put in, or the skin will crack; then let it
boil gently according to its age and weight, an old fowl
requiring twice as long to boil as a young one; allow
fifteen minutes to the pound. Take off all the scum as
it rises, and when done serve with hard-boiled egg
sauce, or parsley, or oyster sauce. This is a nice way
to cook a fat old chicken, as it is much more tender
and nourishing than baked, for if the chicken is old
baking toughens it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">STEW, OR FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN</span></p>

<p>Clean and wash the chicken, cut it up as for frying,
lay it in a stew-pan with water to cover it; add a teaspoonful
of salt and half as much pepper; set it to boil
very gently, take off all scum as it rises. When the
chicken is tender, which will be in an hour, take a teacup
of butter, a tablespoonful of flour worked in it,
and a bunch of parsley, put them in the stew-pan with
the chicken; let all stew twenty minutes, and serve on
toasted bread. Egg-balls around the toast add much
to the beauty of this dish.</p>

with it a quarter of a pound of truffles cut up, a bunch
of parsley, six chives or small green eschalots, a
bruised clove of garlic, and pepper and salt; let them
stew for twenty minutes; then pour off the oil and take
out the parsley. If only one chicken is used, throw in
half a pint of button mushrooms, a ladleful of brown
gravy sauce, and the juice of a lemon. Garnish this

put two ounces of sweet, fresh butter, cut small. Rub
tin or silver scallop pans with butter, strew over the
bottom powdered cracker, lay the minced chicken in,
strew cracker over the top, and bake in a hot oven long
enough to brown the top. Serve with celery or pickle.</p>

a tin cover over it, let it broil quickly until nearly done,
then turn it and finish without the cover. When nicely
browned take it on a dish, season it with salt and pepper,
and butter it freely; turn it once or twice in the
butter and serve it hot.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHICKEN CURRY</span></p>

over the veal a slice of fat ham; on this place your
chickens; place hard-boiled yolks of eggs in among the
chicken. Take half a pint of white sauce, made with
butter, flour, and milk or water; pour this over the
chickens, season with a cup of chopped mushrooms,
some parsley, pepper and salt (a good pie can be made
if you omit the mushrooms and ham, but not so rich as
this recipe); now cover your pie with a good paste,
and bake for an hour or two.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PLAIN CHICKEN PIE</span></p>

<p>Take two nice chickens, or more if they are small, cut
them up as for frying, and put them in a pot to stew
with some slices of fat meat. Let them cook for half
an hour, then add a few onions and four Irish potatoes
sliced small, so that in cooking they may be thoroughly
dissolved in the gravy. Season with pepper, salt, a
little parsley, and a quarter of a pound of sweet butter.
When it is cooked well there should be gravy enough to
cover the chickens. If you want it very nice, beat up
two eggs, and stir into the stew with half a pint of
milk. Line a five-quart pan with a crust made like soda
biscuit, only more shortening; put in the chickens and
gravy; then cover with a top crust. Bake until the
crust is done and you will have a good chicken pie.</p>

fine, pound them in a mortar or pass them through a
sausage grinder; add to this the yolks of three eggs,
and place it by in a basin for use. Peel a pound of
truffles, and cut up a boiled smoked tongue, a pound of
fat bacon, or a pound of calf’s udder or veal. Next
bone a turkey, or two fine capons, or fowls, and draw
the skin from the legs and pinions inside. Take the
turkey on a napkin—it is now limp and boneless—cut
slices from the thick breast and place it on the skin
where it seems to be thin, distribute the flesh of the
fowl as evenly as you can on the skin; season it slightly
with pepper and salt. Spread a layer of the prepared
force-meat in the basin, let it be an inch thick; then
place the cut-up tongue, bacon and veal, lay a row of
chopped truffles and a layer of the force-meat until the
skin is covered, or as full as it will hold. It must be
sewed up the back, the ends tied, like a cushion, or roly-poly;
to do this you must butter a cloth and put it
tightly over the turkey skin, as it will be quite too
tender to stand the cooking, etc., unless supported by a
napkin. Tie it up tightly and place it in a round stewpan
with the bones and any trimmings of veal or
poultry at hand, add to it two boiled calf’s feet, or an
ounce of gelatine, two onions stuck with four cloves, a
bunch of parsley, six green onions, a bunch of sweet
basil, and a bunch of thyme, two blades of mace, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
dozen pepper corns, or whole peppers; moisten all with
half a pint of wine or brandy. Warm this up and put
in your tied-up gelatine, pour over it as much white
veal stock as will cover it well, put it back in the stove
to simmer gently for two hours and a half; let the gelatine
get cold in its own seasoning, and then take it out
and put it under a weight while you remove the stock or
gravy; take off all the cold grease from the surface and
clarify with eggs in the usual way. When the gelatine
is quite cold, remove the weight, take it from its napkin,
wipe it and glaze it, and place it on a dish. Decorate it
with the strained gravy, which should have been placed
on ice as soon as clarified and strained. It will now be
a firm jelly; if not, put it on ice again, and trim the
boned turkey or fowls with it.</p>

<p>Gelatines of turkeys, geese, capons, pheasants, partridges,
etc., are made in the same way. This is from
the finest source, and will repay any one who tries to
make this magnificent dish. It has never, to my knowledge,
been given in an American cook-book, as it was
obtained from one who was <i lang="fr">Chef de Cuisine</i> to a
crowned head of Europe.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">WILD TURKEY</span></p>

<p>If the turkey is old, or tough, it must be boiled one
hour before being stuffed for baking. Then stuff it with
oysters, bread and butter, and season with pepper and
salt; baste with butter, and the juice of the turkey.
Make the gravy by putting in the pan a pint of oysters,
or button mushrooms, throw in a cup of cream, or milk,
salt and pepper, and send to table hot, with the turkey.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">A PLAIN WAY TO COOK A TURKEY BY ROASTING</span></p>

<p>Make a dressing to suit you; there are several to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
choose from in this book, made from bread, or forcemeat.
Stuff the turkey, season it with salt, pepper, and
a little butter, dredge it with flour and put it in the
oven; let the fire be slow at first, and hotter as it begins
to cook. Baste frequently with butter; when the turkey
is well plumped up, and the steam draws toward the
fire, it is nearly done; then dredge again with flour, and
baste with more butter until it is a nice brown. Serve
with gravy and bread sauce; some like chestnuts stewed
in the turkey gravy, and served with it. A very large
turkey will take three hours to roast, one of eight
pounds will take two hours.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ROAST TURKEY A LA PERIGORD</span></p>

<p>For this purpose choose a fine young hen turkey;
make an incision at the back of the neck, and through
this take out the entrails, as the turkey looks so much
nicer than when otherwise cut. Cut away the vent, and
sew up the place with coarse thread; singe off the hairs
and scald the legs to get off the black skin, if the skin is
black, as it sometimes is. The neck should be cut off
close into the back, and the crop left entire; some cooks
can do this and some think it too much trouble. Break
the breast bone and take it out. Lay a little salt on the
turkey, and cover it up, while you prepare the stuffing.
Wash three pounds of truffles, if the hen turkey is a
large one; if it is small two pounds will do. Peel the
truffles and slice them; throw them into water, and
scald them; add two pounds of fat ham, or bacon, also
the turkey liver, and a quarter of a pound of veal liver;
season this with pepper, salt, nutmeg, chopped thyme,
and a clove of garlic. Set the stew-pan, containing all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
these ingredients, on a slow fire, and let them cook for
an hour, stirring them occasionally, with a wooden
spoon. Mash them all up and let it get cool; when cool,
stuff the turkey full of the truffle dressing, and fill the
crop also; sew it up carefully, and tie it with a string,
then truss the turkey, and if time allows, put it away
for the next day. It should then be roasted, keeping
it well basted with the liquor the truffles were boiled
in, and butter added to it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BOILED TURKEY AND CELERY SAUCE</span></p>

<p>Draw a fine, young turkey hen, and remove the angular
part of the breast bone; take two pounds of fat veal
dressing and stuff the turkey with it. Put over the fire
to cook the veal, bones, and turkey giblets, to make
some white soup stock; season this and let it boil until
you want to put the turkey on to cook. Now truss your
turkey and put it in a boiling pot with a carrot, two
onions, a head of celery, and a bunch of sweet herbs;
now pour over the turkey the stock from the veal and
giblets; cover with it, if enough; if not, put in water to
cover it and set it to boil; when it has boiled one hour,
put it on the back of the stove, and let it simmer and
braise, until dinner. Take off any strings that may
look badly; dish it up. Pour over it a well-made <i lang="fr">puree</i>
of celery, or oyster sauce, and send to table. This is
an elegant mode of serving turkey.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BOILED TURKEY WITH OYSTER SAUCE</span></p>

<p>Clean and truss it the same as for baking. Stuff the
turkey with oysters, bread crumbs, butter and mace, all
mixed and seasoned. Put it on the fire in a kettle of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
water not hot, but slightly warm; do not drop it into
boiling water or it will break the skin and spoil the
appearance of the turkey. Cover it close, and when the
scum rises take it off. Let the boiling continue for one
hour, then put the pot containing the turkey on the
coolest part of the stove, and let it simmer for half an
hour. Serve with oyster sauce in a sauce boat.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">DUCK ROASTED</span></p>

<p>Pick, draw and singe the duck; wash it out carefully
and stuff it with potatoes, mashed with butter, onions,
and parsley. Put it down to a good fire or in a hot
oven, pour in a cup of water; let it roast for half an
hour if it is fat and tender, longer if tough. As soon as
the duck is cleaned, boil the giblets, and before serving,
chop them up fine with some of the gravy from the
duck, two tablespoonfuls of catsup, a lump of butter,
and a little brown flour. Have lemons cut on side
dishes, or serve with brown duck sauce No. 1. See
sauces for meats, ducks, etc.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">DUCKS, TAME AND WILD</span></p>

<p>Tame ducks are prepared for the table the same as
young geese, that is, stuffed with bread, butter, pepper
and onion, or with mashed and seasoned Irish potatoes.
Wild ducks should be fat, the claws small and supple;
the hen is the more delicate. Do not scald wild ducks,
but pick them clean and singe over a blaze. Draw and
wipe them well inside with a cloth; rub pepper and
salt inside and out; stuff each duck well with bread and
butter stuffing. If the ducks are at all fishy, use onion
in the stuffing, and baste very freely. It is well to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
parboil them in onion and water before stuffing; throw
away the water and then proceed to stuff and roast
them. Put in the pan a teacup of butter, baste well
with this, and when nearly done, dredge flour over the
ducks, and brown them nicely. For the gravy you must
boil the giblets; while the ducks are cooking mince
these fine; add pepper, salt, and a teaspoonful of
browned flour. Take a glass of wine and a large spoonful
of currant jelly; heat them and serve with the
ducks, mixed with the giblets, or serve it in a dish
alone; as you like.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CANVAS-BACK DUCKS</span></p>

<p>These are cooked the same as wild ducks, without
onion however, in the basting, as they have no disagreeable
taste. Serve wine and currant jelly with
canvas-back ducks.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO STEW DUCKS WITH GREEN PEAS</span></p>

<p>Truss the ducks as for baking and boiling, and put
them away in the pantry; then put two ounces of butter
in a stew-pan on the fire, stir in two tablespoonfuls
of flour, stir until it becomes brown or a fawn color;
then pour in a pint of broth or gravy made from veal,
or from water in which the ducks or chickens have been
boiled. Stir this while cooking, and when it boils, put
in the ducks; let them cook for half an hour, or until
done or nearly so, then add a quart of green peas, an
onion chopped, and a sprig of parsley; allow these to
stew gently until done; remove the parsley and the
ducks, and if there is too much sauce, cook it down a
little; dish up, pour the peas and gravy over the ducks
and serve.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">ROASTED DUCK</span></p>

<p>Clean, draw and truss the duck, or ducks, wash them
nicely, salt and pepper them, and get ready a sage and
onion stuffing (see roast goose) or stuff with mashed
potatoes, or bread, butter, onions, pepper and salt
mixed, and bound together with an egg.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BROILED TEAL DUCK</span></p>

<p>Split the duck like a partridge down the back, broil
on clear coals, butter freely, and serve on buttered
toast; pepper and salt when broiled, just before putting
on the butter; if salted before it extracts the fine flavor.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">WILD DUCKS</span></p>

<p>There are several kinds of ducks South, and some are
very fine. Truss wild ducks and lay them in a pan to
bake with a small onion in the body; put butter over
them, with a bunch of celery, a little pepper and salt;
cook slowly and garnish with lemon. Wild ducks should
be wiped dry after they are drawn, and rubbed on the
inside with pepper and salt, except the canvas-back,
which should be left to its own delicious flavor.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">WILD GEESE</span></p>

<p>Wild geese should be cooked rare, and stuffed with a
dressing of bread, butter, and a small quantity of pungent
seasoning, such as onion, cayenne, or mustard.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ROAST GOOSE, WITH SAGE AND ONION</span></p>

<p>Draw a fine fat goose, stuff it with a seasoning of the
following mixture: Take four onions, peel them and
boil them ten minutes in plenty of water to take from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
them the strong taste. When the onions have boiled
take them from the fire, chop fine, and add to them a
large spoonful of sage leaves dried and powdered, then
add a cupful of stale white bread crumbs, a teaspoon
of black pepper, a little cayenne, and a teaspoon of
salt. Mix all together with a cup of milk or beef
water, and stuff the goose with it. Put it in the oven
and brown it nicely; baste often with butter; when
done dish it with its own rich brown gravy, and send to
table with a boat of apple sauce.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">GOOSE, WITH CHESTNUTS A LA CHIPOLITA</span></p>

<p>Get the goose ready as usual. To prepare the stuffing
take sixty large chestnuts, peel them by scalding,
then put them in a stew pan with two ounces of butter,
one onion chopped fine, and a sprig of parsley; chop
and mix all together and stuff the goose with it; mix
with the chestnuts one pint of good broth, and stew
them down in it before stuffing the goose. Boil down
the gravy very much, and when the goose is served,
add the juice of two oranges, half a pound of currant
jelly, and a lemon peel in the gravy. Pour this over
the goose when it goes to the table.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">GAME, VENISON, ETC.</span></p>

<p>Venison is the finest game we have South. The
haunch or saddle is always roasted; it requires constant
attention, and should be turned and basted frequently
while cooking. Cover the fat with thick white
paper while cooking; when nearly done, take off the
paper and baste well with claret wine, butter and flour.
Currant jelly is the usual accompaniment of roasted
venison, and is preferred by some to wine, in cooking
it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">VENISON STEAK</span></p>

<p>Venison steak is good fried or broiled. If to be
broiled, season with pepper, salt, and butter, and cook
quickly on a hot gridiron. If the meat is not fat, make
a gravy for it of wine, flour, and butter. Serve hot.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">VENISON PASTY</span></p>

<p>This is a pie made from the bones, meat, etc., of
venison, after the steak and haunch are taken off. Cut
up and stew, or braise the parts of meat intended for
the pie; season with pepper, salt, port wine, butter,
and if liked, mushrooms; stew all until tender, then
make a paste and finish like chicken pie. This is better
to eat cold than hot and should be rich enough to be a
solid jelly when cold.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SQUIRREL, OR YOUNG RABBIT PIE</span></p>

<p>Cut up two or three young squirrels or rabbits; put
them in a saucepan to cook with two ounces of butter,
a handful of chopped mushrooms, a bunch of parsley
and two shallots chopped; season with pepper and salt,
and a little thyme or sweet herbs; cook them a light
brown. Throw in a glass of white wine, a half cup of
brown gravy from veal or chicken, and the juice of
half a lemon. Toss all up on the fire fifteen or twenty
minutes, and it is ready to be put in the pie. If you
have no gravy on hand, add to the rabbits a cup of
sweet milk, and a piece of butter, as large as a hen’s
egg. Make a nice paste, line the sides of the pan, pour
in the stewed rabbit, and cover with paste. Bake until
a light brown, and eat cold or hot. It is almost as good
as venison pie.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">HARE OR RABBIT ROASTED</span></p>

<p>If the hares and rabbits are young, the ears will be
tender. Clean the rabbits and wash them through
several waters. If to be roasted, they must be stuffed
with grated bread crumbs, suet or butter, a chopped
onion, the liver of the rabbit chopped, and a lemon peel
grated. Moisten with eggs and a little claret. Put this
in the rabbit and sew it up; baste with butter, and
cook for two hours. Make the gravy with the drippings
in the pan, a little cream or milk, and flour. If
the rabbits are old, they are good stewed slowly with
sweet herbs, wine, water, and chopped onions, and
thickened with flour and butter.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CEDAR, OR CAROLINA RICE BIRDS</span></p>

<p>These are very small, but make a delicious pie by
stewing them with butter and sweet herbs, and baking
them in a light paste, with plenty of gravy.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PARTRIDGE OR QUAILS</span></p>

<p>Are nice roasted or broiled, and served on toast. If
baked they require constant basting.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PIGEON PIE. VERY NICE</span></p>

<p>Take six pigeons, truss them, and stuff them with
their own livers, a little bacon, some butter, parsley,
and rolled cracker or a small piece of bread; salt to
taste; cover the bottom of the baking dish with slices
of veal or beef; season with chopped parsley, mushrooms,
pepper, salt, and butter. Place the pigeons on
this, and cover with a nice pie crust. When the pigeons
are placed in the pan, lay between each two pigeons
the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs. Be sure and have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
enough gravy to keep the pie very moist. This can be
done by adding plain beef-stock or water as the pie
bakes. Parboil the pigeons a little, also the beef, before
putting them in the pan, and then keep the water
they were boiled in to fill up the pie.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ROAST PIGEONS</span></p>

<p>Truss them when plucked and drawn, lay thin slices
of fat bacon on their breasts; bake them three-quarters
of an hour, and then make a gravy with their giblets,
which should have been boiling for the purpose.
Chop up the livers, etc., brown them and serve with the
pigeons. Thin the gravy with the stock the liver was
boiled in.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO ROAST A SUCKING PIG</span></p>

<p>In selecting a pig for the table, one four weeks old is
to be preferred. Let the pig be prepared in the usual
way by the butcher, that is scalded, drawn, etc. Stuff it
with a mixture of two or three onions, say half a pint
when sliced and chopped, and a dozen leaves of sage,
pepper and salt; set this to simmer on the fire, then
throw in half a pint of bread crumbs if the pig is small—if
a large one, put a pint of crumbs—a quarter of a
pound of butter, and the yolks of four eggs. Cook this
and stuff the pig with it; sew the pig up and put it in
the oven to roast; baste it often with a brush or swab
dipped in olive oil, dust a little sugar over it, and brown
it evenly. Take off the head before serving, take out
the brains, put them in a stew pan; add to them some
chopped parsley, pepper, and salt, a cup of the gravy
from the pig, and the juice of a lemon. Stir this over
the fire, and send it to the table hot in a separate boat.

<p>Boil them without peeling; peel them while hot, mash
them up with sweet butter, a little milk, pepper and
salt. Many like them better when mashed and smoothed
over with a knife blade, and slightly browned in the

occasions.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">STEWED IRISH POTATOES. A NICE BREAKFAST DISH</span></p>

<p>Wash, peel, and slice six potatoes; throw them for a
few moments into cold, salted water, take them out in
five minutes and place them in a stew pan on the fire;
cover them with cold water; when tender, throw off
all the water, pour over them half a cup of sweet milk,
a little salt, pepper, and chopped parsley, and thicken
them with a spoonful of butter, rolled in flour, or a teaspoonful
of flour, beaten in carefully to prevent it from
lumping; stew a few moments and serve in a covered
dish.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PUFFS</span></p>

<p>Very nice potato puffs may be made by mashing
seven or eight potatoes smoothly, and mixing in with
them two well-beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of melted

into a pan and bake in a hot stove.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">FRIED POTATOES</span></p>

<p>Wash and pare a sufficient quantity for the meal.
Slice them in the machine, taking care to bear down
lightly, so as to have the slices very thin. Have ready
a vessel of very hot lard, and drop the sliced potatoes
into it, letting them remain till they begin to brown.
Take them out with a wire ladle, scatter a little fine
salt over them, and serve while hot. Success depends
almost entirely upon having the lard sufficiently hot.
If the potatoes do not brown, but absorb fat, and are
limp and greasy, be sure the lard must be made hotter.
Properly fried, they may be eaten with relish when
cold, as they are crisp and palatable.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">FRIED POTATOES</span></p>

<p>Pare and cut the potatoes in thin slices; throw them
as you cut them into salted water to cool, and make
them crisp. Put them piece by piece on a dry towel

to float them. As they brown dip them out with a skimmer,
and salt them a little.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">POTATO CROQUETS</span></p>

<p>Take six boiled potatoes (cold mashed potatoes will

hot lard and some of the beefsteak gravy, fried gently
until a light color, and served around the steak.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">GREEN CORN ON THE COB</span></p>

<p>Get it as fresh from the field as possible, and if you
desire it boiled on the cob you must (when it is well
silked) throw it into boiling salted water. Corn requires
only fifteen minutes boiling; too long boiling
takes out the sweetness from the grain.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">STEWED GREEN CORN</span></p>

<p>Take a dozen fresh, tender ears of corn; cut it off
the cob, and put it in a stew pan with a quart of cold
water. No salt at first. Let it cook half an hour and
then stir in a lump of fresh butter, a spoonful of flour,

this batter, and fry in hog’s lard; fry parsley with it
and serve.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TOMATOES STUFFED</span></p>

<p>Take five large tomatoes, slice off that part which
joins the stalk, cut out a little of their pulp, take out
the seeds, and strain them; chop up the pulp with a
handful of parsley, a slice of fat bacon, a slice of ham,
and a cup of bread crumbs; fry all these, and season
with butter, pepper, salt, thyme, and the yolks of two
eggs; take it off the fire as soon as the eggs are beaten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
in, and stuff the tomatoes. Bake them for half an hour,
pour some brown sauce or gravy over them and serve.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TOMATOES TO BROIL</span></p>

<p>Take ripe, red tomatoes, place them on the gridiron,
broil, and turn until done through; then serve them
whole, so that they can be seasoned at the table.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">STEWED TOMATOES, WITH OR WITHOUT SUGAR</span></p>

<p>Pour boiling water over six or eight large, ripe tomatoes,
let them remain in it a few minutes to scald
the skins, then take them out and skin them. Chop
them up and put them to stew with a little salt, pepper,
and a small piece of butter; then add a spoonful of
rolled cracker or toasted bread, and a tablespoonful of
sugar, if liked; if not, omit the sugar, and let them
stew gently, for half an hour longer.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO COOK SPINACH</span></p>

<p>Wash in two or three waters, as the grit adheres
very closely to spinach; when well washed, boil it one
half hour in clear water; add a little soda, if it does
not look a nice green. When soft, drain it well and
chop very fine—it cannot be too fine; add butter, salt if
needed, and pepper to taste; garnish with hard-boiled
eggs cut in fancy shapes; or, in early spring, it is nice
to poach two or three eggs, and lay on the freshly
cooked spinach.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ASPARAGUS ON TOAST</span></p>

<p>The fresher this vegetable is the better; and in picking
and washing it, all stalks not crisp and tender
should be thrown aside. Cut off nearly all the horny
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
white parts, tie the rest in neat bunches, and boil in
salted water for twenty minutes or half an hour; then
take it out, let it drain a minute and lay on buttered
toast, the heads all one way; cover with rich drawn
butter sauce.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ASPARAGUS WITH CREAM</span></p>

<p>When cream is plentiful, cut the asparagus in inch
pieces, boil, and then throw it into rich hot cream, with
seasoning of pepper and salt.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">STEWED MUSHROOMS ON TOAST</span></p>

<p>Pull out the stems of the mushrooms, and peel them;
melt a tablespoonful of butter in a stew pan, throw into
the butter a little salt, pepper, and powdered mace (if
liked), lay the mushrooms in this, upper side down,
and stew till they are tender, which will be in about
twenty minutes. Fry a slice of bread until it is a light
brown, and then arrange the mushrooms over it. Serve
hot.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">EGG PLANT</span></p>

<p>Parboil egg plant, slice it and dip each piece in
beaten egg and roll it in pounded cracker; then drop
it in hot lard and fry brown. Season with salt and
pepper. They are delicious cooked this way, and taste
<a id="chg5"></a>like soft-shelled crabs. Another way is to parboil them,
mash them up and season with eggs, onions, pepper,
salt and butter; then place the mixture back in the
shell, and bake. Serve in their shells.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ANOTHER WAY TO COOK EGG PLANT</span></p>

<p>Parboil, slice them, and without rolling them in anything
drop them into boiling lard; season with salt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
and pepper. Some like them mashed and added to a
batter of eggs, flour and milk, seasoned with pepper
and salt, and then dropped like fritters into hot lard.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BURR ARTICHOKES</span></p>

<p>Get them young or they are not tender, wash them in
salted water, and put them to boil. Boil until you can
pull off a leaf easily; salt them and serve with drawn-butter
sauce, with vinegar in it, or mustard and oil, as
preferred.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SNAP BEANS, STEWED AND BOILED</span></p>

<p>Pick and snap them when green and tender, cut them
small, and throw into boiling water; let them cook
gently for two hours; then stir in a half cup of broth,
and a cup of milk; let them stew in this for half an
hour longer; season with salt and pepper to taste.
Many like them cooked with a piece of lean side bacon.
They require several hours boiling, if not very young.
Put the beans in first, and when half done, put in a
pound or so of bacon to an ordinary mess of beans.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">GREEN ENGLISH PEAS, TO STEW</span></p>

<p>Shell a quart of green peas for a small mess. Wash
them in cold water, and put them on to cook in a stew
pan with a pint of boiling water, or enough to cover
them. Let them cook half an hour, and then stir in a
large lump of butter rolled in flour; let this cook a few
minutes, and add a teaspoonful of white sugar, same
of salt and pepper, and serve while hot. Do not let
them cook dry. Lamb and green peas is a favorite
dish in the spring of the year.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">MARROWFAT PEAS</span></p>

<p>This is a late sort of green pea, and is much richer in
taste than the earlier ones, but not so delicate. They
must be dressed like the early peas, by boiling in water,
and when soft, pour off the water. They are sometimes
a little strong if the water is not changed. Fill up with
milk, or milk and water, and boil a little longer, then
season with butter, pepper and salt, and thicken with
a teaspoon of flour stirred in among the peas.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LIMA, OR BUTTER BEANS</span></p>

<p>Shell them, and lay them in cold water for an hour
or so before cooking; this renders them more delicate
and mealy. When ready to cook, put them in a stew
pan in boiling water enough to cover them; let them
boil fast and keep them covered while cooking; examine
them in an hour, and if soft, pour off nearly all
the water and stir in a lump of butter, some pepper
and salt. Lima beans and sweet corn make the finest
succotash, although string beans are generally used.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SQUASH, STEWED</span></p>

<p>If not very young, you must peel the squashes, steam
or boil them until tender, and season them with sweet
milk or cream, and a little butter, pepper and salt; let
them stew down in this until they are thick, and of the
consistence of mashed potatoes. Another way is to
take them from the steamer, mash them with a cut-up
onion, and a slice or two of ham; then stew them down
thick, adding pepper and salt to taste.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">STEWED SUMMER SQUASH</span></p>

<p>Gather them while young and tender. Peel, cut them
up, take out the seeds, and put them on to boil; let
them cook rapidly until very tender. Drain them well
in a colander, and mash with a wooden spoon. Put this
pulp in a stew pan with a small piece of butter, a gill
of cream, and a little pepper and salt; cook this, and
stir constantly until the squash is dry. Serve very hot.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PUMPKIN WITH SALT MEAT</span></p>

<p>This is very good cooked with salt meat and brown
sugar. Slice the pumpkin and put it in the oven with
brown sugar, or good molasses; slice some smoked
meat and lay it in among the pumpkin; cook it tender.
It is better than many things with more reputation.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CAULIFLOWER, WITH WHITE SAUCE</span></p>

<p>Remove the green stalks, and if the heads are large,
divide them into quarters; wash and boil them with a
little pepper, butter and salt; serve with drawn butter
or white sauce, when they become soft and tender.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">STEWED CABBAGE</span></p>

<p>Cold cabbage left from dinner can be drained from
the pot liquor in which it was boiled, and then simmered
for half an hour in water, or milk and water;
pour off all the water when it is tender, and stir in the
pot a lump of butter or clarified drippings; let it cook
gently, then throw in a cup of milk or cream; thicken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
it with flour, and season with pepper and salt. Serve
with the cream gravy poured over the cabbage.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BEETS BOILED</span></p>

<p>Wash the beets clean, but do not trim the roots, or
they will bleed and lose their sweetness. If the beets
are young and tender, they are nice cooked whole, and
then stewed in a little butter, with sugar, salt and vinegar
added. Let them simmer in this batter for twenty
minutes, and serve. If the beets are large, boil, and
slice them when cooked, and season with vinegar, pepper
and salt, or slice them, and serve with butter.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PARSNIP FRITTERS</span></p>

<p>Boil the parsnips in salted water until they are done;
make a batter of an egg, a spoonful of milk and flour,
pepper and salt, and when the parsnips are cool
enough to handle cut them in rounds, dip them in the
batter and drop them into hot lard; fry a light brown,
turn them and fry the other side. When brown on both
sides, drain them from the grease. They are good,
mashed like turnips.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MACARONI IN A MOULD</span></p>

<p>Boil macaroni till it is tender, line a mould with it,
fitting it in closely. Make a mince of any kind of meat,
raw or cooked; season with sweet herbs, butter, pepper,
chopped eschalot, and a couple of eggs; fill the mould
with this and boil for twenty minutes. Serve with
white sauce No. 10 put around the macaroni.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">MACARONI AND GRATED CHEESE</span></p>

<p>Take a quarter of a pound of macaroni, break into
lengths, and throw it into cold water to soak, an hour
or so after breakfast. Boil it an hour, take it out of
the pot and put in the bottom of the pan a layer of the
boiled macaroni and then a layer of grated cheese;
strew over the top a teaspoonful of salt and some
lumps of butter as big as a nutmeg. Then fill up the
pan with new milk and bake until browned on top, but
never let it get dry; it is better to put water in, if your
milk has given out, than to let it get the least dry. This
is a rich dish when well made, but a poor one if badly
made, and served dry.

</div>
<hr class="medium">

<p><em>In choosing eggs</em> hold each one up to the light; if
fresh, the white will be clear and the yolk distinct; if
they are not good, they will have a clouded appearance.</p>

<p><em>Eggs for boiling</em> must be as fresh as possible; they
may be kept fresh for several weeks by packing them
in bran. Lay the small end of the egg downward in the
box. You may also keep them for months by greasing
them with melted lard, or beef fat, or in a weak brine
of lime water and salt; strong lime water will eat the
shell, and if <em>very</em> strong will cook the eggs. Add to a
common bucket of water a pint of salt and a pint of
lime; stir it well, and it is ready to receive the eggs.</p>

<p><em>Omelets</em> require a thick bottomed pan, as an ordinary
pan is too thin and would scorch the eggs before
they could be properly cooked. For turning omelets,
eggs, fried parsley, etc., have a skimmer spoon with a
flat, thin blade, with holes, to let the fat from the fry.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO BOIL EGGS IN THEIR SHELLS, SOFT OR HARD</span></p>

<p>Wash the eggs clean, drop them as wanted in a stewpan
of boiling water; if you desire them soft, let them
boil just three minutes by the watch; if only the yolk is
to be soft five minutes will do it; but if wanted very
hard for salad, sandwiches, etc., let them boil ten or
fifteen minutes. Then put them in cold water, to make
them peel easily. If soft-boiled eggs are kept in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
shell before eating them, they will harden very much
from the heat of the shell.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">EGGS, AU GRATIN, FOR LENT</span></p>

<p>Boil the eggs hard, peel and cut them in slices, and
lay them in a deep dish in close circular rows. Make a
sauce of a tablespoonful of butter, the yolks of four
eggs, a little grated cheese and half a cup of sweet
milk. Stir this over the fire until it thickens, pour it
over the eggs, strew some bread crumbs on the top, and
bake for about ten minutes; then send to table hot.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">POACHED EGGS WITH TOAST AND ANCHOVY PASTE</span></p>

<p>Toast six pieces of bread, shape them round, before
browning; keep them where they will be hot until you
poach the eggs. Take a tin dipper, half fill it with boiling
water, and drop it gently into the pot again, holding
it so that none of the water from the pot can get
into the dipper; keep it firm by holding it yourself or
getting it held for you, and break a nice fresh egg into
the dipper; let it stand until the white is firm. Lay
each egg on one of the slices of toast, use butter and
salt on the toast for both egg and toast; break each egg
in this way until your six eggs and six pieces of toast
are used; butter very freely, and serve hot. Anchovy
paste may be spread on the toast before the eggs are
put on, but it is a nice dish without it and very suitable
for a delicate breakfast.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">POACHED EGGS AND HAM</span></p>

<p>Poach your eggs in a tin dipper, as directed, and
when done put them on round slices of broiled or fried
ham. Many prefer this to fried ham and eggs.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">EGGS WITH BROWNED BUTTER AND VINEGAR</span></p>

<p>Put four ounces of butter into an omelet pan over
the fire; as it begins to sputter, break the eggs into it
without disturbing the yolks, season with pepper and
salt; fry the eggs carefully and remove them on to the
dish in which they are to be served. Put two ounces
more butter in the pan, fry it of a brown color; put to
the butter two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, pour it over
the eggs and serve.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">OMELETTE AU NATUREL</span></p>

<p>Break eight eggs into a bowl; add a teaspoonful of
salt, half as much pepper, beat up the whole very hard
and throw in a tablespoonful of water. Have the omelet-pan
on the fire with a cup of sweet butter heated to
a gentle heat (fierce heat would scorch the eggs); pour
the eggs into the heated butter; raise it as it cooks,
with a skimmer-spoon, turn in the brown edges, or
turn one half over the other, as it keeps in the lusciousness
of the omelet. Keep gently rolling it, as it cooks,
until, when done, it is round like a small roly-poly
pudding. Omelette au naturel is the basis of all omelets,
for, by substituting different seasonings, you have
all the varieties of them. Parsley and onion chopped
fine and mixed with the eggs is one variety; grated
ham and parsley is another; sugar makes another class,
and so on.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">A NICE OMELET WITH GREEN ONION</span></p>

<p>Beat the whites and yolks of six eggs separately, put
in a tablespoonful of butter, a spoonful of chopped
green onion and one of fine-cut parsley, and mix with
the eggs; then put it into a thick-bottomed pan, in
which you have placed a half cup of butter. Roll it up
as it cooks, and tilt the pan on one side, that the omelet
may cook on the other side; roll up again as it cooks.
Do not let it get hard and brown, but keep it soft. Keep
on rolling as well as you can; a little practice will make
you perfect. When the eggs cook, butter, pepper and
salt them, and turn on a dish.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">OMELET FOR ONE PERSON</span></p>

<p>Beat two eggs—yolks and whites separately; in a
bowl put a tablespoonful of water, a little parsley, a
teaspoonful of butter, and a little green onion, if liked;
beat the eggs into this, and whisk all very rapidly for
a few minutes; then pour it into a pan, where there is a
tablespoonful of butter just hot enough to color the
eggs; cook them very slowly, and roll up the omelet as
it cooks until it is like a rolled pancake; pepper and
salt it at the last moment of cooking, as putting in salt
too soon makes eggs tough.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">OMELET WITH PARMESAN CHEESE</span></p>

<p>Break six eggs into a bowl, add a gill of cream, four
ounces of grated cheese, some pepper and a little salt;
beat the whole together, pour into a pan, roll up and
bake as directed. Butter it well before sending to table.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">OMELET WITH SUGAR</span></p>

<p>Beat six eggs, whites and yolks separately, with
seven spoonfuls of powdered sugar. Flavor with lemon,
and bake like a pudding for ten or fifteen minutes, or
just long enough to set the eggs. Longer baking will
spoil the jelly-like consistency of the omelet.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">OMELETTE SOUFFLE</span></p>

<p>Beat six eggs, the whites and yolks separately; put
to the yolks four dessertspoonfuls of white sugar powdered,
and the yellow rind of a lemon chopped very
fine; mix them thoroughly, whip the whites to a high
froth and add them to the yolks. Put quarter of a
pound of butter into the pan, over a brisk fire, and as
soon as it is completely melted pour in the mixture;
stir it that the butter may be completely incorporated
with the eggs. When it is so, put it in a buttered dish
and set it over hot embers or ashes, strew powdered
sugar over the top and color it with a hot shovel; this
may be done in the oven. Serve as soon as possible, as
it soon falls and so the appearance is spoiled.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">OMELETTE SOUFFLE IN A MOULD</span></p>

<p>Break six fresh eggs, separate the whites from the
yolks, put with the yolks three spoonfuls of rice flour
and a tablespoonful of orange-flower water; stir these
well together, whip the whites of the eggs to a high
froth, and mix them with the yolks. Pour the mixture
into a buttered mould, about half full; bake it in a
moderate oven for half an hour. When done turn it on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
to a dish and serve quickly. This omelet must be clear
and shake like a jelly.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">A DELICIOUS OMELET</span></p>

<p>Beat separately, and lightly, six eggs; add to them a
tablespoonful of chopped green onion, and the same of
parsley, chopped fine; beat them into the eggs with
two tablespoonfuls of water, and at the last moment
a little salt. Have a thick-bottomed skillet or pan on
the fire, put in a teaspoonful of nice sweet butter, and
when this is hot put in the eggs. Take a broad-bladed
knife and keep rolling the omelet as it sets; do not let
it get too brown, but roll it in an oblong shape; never
turn an omelet over, but push and roll it, as described,
then slide it on a hot dish, pour a spoonful of melted
butter over it, and send it to table hot. A wood fire is
the best, over which to cook an omelet, as you want
only a blaze; a great heat in the stove makes it impossible
to have the eggs of the light delicate brown
required.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SPANISH OMELET</span></p>

<p>Beat up six eggs until quite light, add to them a cup
of chopped ham and two small onions minced very fine.
The onions should be cooked a little before being put
into the eggs, or they will not be cooked enough. When
mixed together put it into a thick-bottomed pan and
commence rolling. When it is a light brown, give it the
last roll, let it lie a moment in the pan, then dish it.
Put fresh butter as it goes to table, for the butter the
omelet is fried in is never good to send to table.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">OMELET WITH OYSTERS</span></p>

<p>Break eight or ten eggs in a basin, whip them up well,
add a gill of cream, a tablespoonful of sweet butter, a
spoonful of chopped parsley, pepper and salt to taste;
beat it again very light, then stir in a pint of chopped
oysters, and when the butter is hot put in the omelet.
When the eggs have partly set, roll the omelet in form
of a cushion, which you can do by using the tin slice.
Brown delicately, and serve with a little melted butter
or some sauce you prefer.</p>

<p>Grated Parmesan cheese is very fine in place of the
chopped oysters; also, ham, in the above omelet, is an
acceptable addition.

<p>Parsley is most universally used to garnish all kinds

many kinds. Horse-radish is much liked on roast beef;
slices of lemon are liked by many on broiled fish or

lamb, and currant jelly is generally liked on game,
ducks, etc.</p>

each quart a spoonful of <a id="chg6"></a>vinegar, half a spoonful of
pepper and a teaspoonful of cloves; pour all this in a
stone jar, and place the jar in a pot of boiling water;
let it boil two hours, then strain it without squeezing
the mushrooms. Boil the juice fifteen minutes, and
skim it well; let it stand a few hours to settle; bottle
and cork it well. Keep it cool, or it will ferment.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">A DELICIOUS FLAVOR FROM THYME, ETC.</span></p>

<p>A delicious flavor from thyme, mint, sweet marjoram

in full perfection. They should be picked from the
stalks and put into a large jar, then pour strong vinegar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
or brandy over them; let them stay in this twenty-four
hours, then take the herbs out, and throw in fresh
bunches; do this three times, then strain the liquor or
vinegar. Cork and seal the bottles tight. Do not let
the herbs stay more than twenty or twenty-four hours
in the liquid before straining, for fear of imparting an
unsavory taste. This is very useful in soups.</p>

cold, bottle it, put a teaspoonful of sweet oil in each
bottle; cork them tight, and keep in a dry place.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TOMATO CATSUP. RECIPE FOR MAKING A SMALL QUANTITY</span></p>

<p>Take a gallon of ripe tomatoes, skin them by pouring
boiling water over them; let them get cold and put
them in a stew pan with four tablespoonfuls of salt, and
the same of ground black pepper, half a spoonful of
ground allspice, and three spoonfuls of ground mustard.
Throw in eight pods of red pepper, and let all
stew slowly until the tomatoes are soft and tender.
Thin the mixture with enough vinegar to allow the
catsup to be strained through a sieve; cook it fifteen
minutes, and bottle up when cold. This will last in any
climate, if well boiled and made according to these
directions. Keep always in a cool, dark closet or cellar.
Light ruins all catsups, pickles or preserves, when they
are exposed to it. This is a fine recipe.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">FRENCH CHICKEN SALAD</span></p>

<p>Roast one or two nice chickens, season them well,
and when cooked, put them by to cool. Just before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
serving the dish, carve the fowls in small pieces, taking
out all the large bones. Make a dressing of the
yolks of six hard-boiled eggs to each fowl, mash the
yolks very smooth with a wooden spoon and pour
gently on them in a little stream a cup of olive oil;
beat the eggs all one way till they are creamed. Add
now a cup of vinegar to two fowls, a half cup to one,
pepper, salt, and drop a little vinegar on the fowl, then
pour on the dressing. Arrange on the dish, cool, fresh
lettuce heads quartered, and slice six more hard-boiled
eggs over all as a garnish. A few red beets are a
handsome addition, mixed with the green lettuce and
yellow eggs.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHICKEN SALAD FOR A SMALL COMPANY</span></p>

<p>Boil four eggs hard, throw them in cold water; when
cool, take the yolks of two in a bowl, pour over them
a spoonful of mixed mustard, an ounce of sweet oil, a
saltspoonful of salt, and a little black pepper; mix this
carefully, pouring in the oil a little at a time; when
it is smooth, pour in four tablespoonfuls of good vinegar,
and one-half a teaspoonful of sugar. This is the
dressing for your salad.</p>

<p>The chicken is supposed to be already boiled or
baked. When cold, pick all the flesh from the bones
and pile it in the centre of a glass bowl, or dish; mix
with it three heads of celery, cut up fine, and season
it with pepper and salt. About the time you wish it
served, take six or seven heads of white-heart lettuce,
split them, and place them closely around the cut-up
chicken, and pour over it all the dressing. This is a
plain and economical way, but if wanted richer, it is
easy to add more eggs, and trim the salad with sliced
hard-boiled eggs, over the top.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">A NICE CHICKEN SALAD</span></p>

<p>Cut up the white parts of four or five heads of
celery, reserving the green leaves. Pick all the meat
from a fine baked chicken, chop this up, and mix it
with the cut-up celery; lay it in a glass or china dish,
where it will be cool.</p>

<p>To make the dressing, rub the yolks of six hard-boiled
eggs to a paste, with two spoonfuls of mixed
mustard, a teaspoonful of white sugar, and enough oil
to make it perfectly smooth; put this in slowly, a little
at a time, and finish the dressing by pouring in half
a cup of vinegar. Pour this over the celery and chicken,
and garnish with white heads of split lettuce, also the
reserved celery leaves, and four sliced hard-boiled
eggs.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">POTATO SALAD</span></p>

<p>Slice a pint of cold potatoes, put them in a dish,
chop over them six eschalots, pepper and salt them,
and pour over them a dressing of two tablespoonfuls
of oil, one of made mustard, and half a cup of vinegar;
it is better without eggs.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">POTATO SALAD</span></p>

<p>Slice cold potatoes, add to them chopped eschalots,

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TOMATO SALAD, WITH OR WITHOUT SHRIMP</span></p>

<p>Slice a dozen large tomatoes, slice with them three
or four sweet peppers, then pepper and salt the tomatoes;
lay slices of tomato and a little sweet pepper
until the dish is full. Pour over all a dressing of oil,
mustard and vinegar. A pint of shelled shrimp is a
great improvement to this salad, but it is good without.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">JAMBALAYA OF FOWLS AND RICE</span></p>

<p>Cut up and stew a fowl; when half done, add a cup
of raw rice, a slice of ham minced, and pepper and
salt; let all cook together until the rice swells and
absorbs all the gravy of the stewed chicken, but it
must not be allowed to get hard or dry. Serve in a
deep dish. Southern children are very fond of this;
it is said to be an Indian dish, and very wholesome as
well as palatable; it can be made of many things.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">COLD SLAW WITH HOT SAUCE</span></p>

<p>Chop fine a firm white head of cabbage, or better
than that, slice it with a patent slicer; lay it in very
cold water for an hour, then take it out, drain it, and
when drained thoroughly, place it in the dish it is to
be served in and pour over it the following sauce:
Take two cups of strong vinegar to a quart of cut
cabbage, stir in it one teaspoonful of mustard and salt,
a tablespoonful of butter, and three teaspoons of white
sugar. Make this all hot, and at the last moment stir
in the yolks of two or three eggs; stir rapidly and pour
on to the chopped cabbage in the dish. It should be
served instantly or the sauce will harden.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PLAIN COLD SLAW, WITH VINEGAR</span></p>

<p>This is made by chopping or slicing the cabbage as
in the above recipe. When it is soaked, and is cool
and firm, dust pepper on it, throw in a little salt and
pour over it a cup of cold, sharp vinegar. Sliced hard-boiled
eggs are a great improvement if put over the
cabbage when sent to table. Sliced onions also make
a good salad when seasoned with salt, pepper and vinegar.
Mix a little sweet, sliced vegetable pepper with
the onions.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PICKLES">PICKLES</h2>
</div>
<hr class="medium">

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">HINTS ON THEIR MANAGEMENT</span></p>

<p>Pickles should always have vinegar enough to cover
them; those intended for immediate use should be
kept in wide-top stone-ware jars. Keep a cloth folded
upon the pickles, and the jar covered with a plate or
wooden vessel; they should occasionally be looked over,
and the softest and least likely to keep, used first.
Pickles intended for use the following summer should
be assorted from the remainder when first made;
choose those most firm, and of equal size; put them
into stone, or glass-ware, with fresh vinegar to cover
them; cover the vessel close, with several thicknesses
of paper, or a tin cover, or if wide-mouthed bottles are
used, cork them tightly.</p>

<p>Cucumbers may be put down in a strong salt and
water brine, to be greened and pickled as they are
wanted. Keep them under the brine. When wanted,
freshen them in two or three changes of water, for two
or three days, until by cutting one open, you find it but
little salt; then pour scalding vinegar over them three
times, and keep them covered; add spices and seasoning
to the vinegar, to suit the taste.</p>

<p>The vessels in which pickles have been, whether of
glass, wood, or stone, will never be fit for preserved
fruit; they will surely spoil if put in them. After
pickles are used, throw out the vinegar, wash the
vessels first in cold water, then pour hot water into
them, cover and let it remain until cold, then wash,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
wipe, and dry them near the fire or in the sun, and
set them away for future use. Wooden ware will require
to be wet occasionally, or to be kept in a damp
place, that it may not become leaky. Should catsups
seem frothy or foamy, put them in a bright brass, or
porcelain kettle, over the fire; boil slowly, and skim
until no more scum rises, then turn into an earthen
vessel to cool, after which put in bottles and stop
them tight.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO PICKLE CUCUMBERS PLAIN WITHOUT SPICES</span></p>

<p>Take one hundred small cucumbers, or more, if you
wish, salt them freely, and let them remain eight or
ten hours; then drain them, put them into boiling
vinegar enough to cover them, and place vine leaves
among and over them to green them; let them scald a
few minutes in the vinegar, and take them from the
fire, but place them near it to keep warm and become
green; if the leaves turn yellow, put fresh ones among
them. When green you can pack them away in jars;
season them at any time you may desire, as they
will keep well if scalded thoroughly with the boiling
vinegar.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CUCUMBER PICKLES IN WHISKEY</span></p>

<p>Prepare your cucumbers as usual by letting them
stay a few days in brine, or if time is an object scald
them in brine, and then proceed to pickle them. The
same brine may be used many times, pouring it boiling
hot on each mess of cucumbers. If you have no vinegar
convenient drop your scalded cucumbers into a
mixture of one part whiskey and three parts water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Secure them carefully from the air, and by Christmas
they will be fine, firm, green pickles, and the whiskey
and water will be excellent vinegar. Add spices after
they are pickled. If you do not wish all your pickles
spiced, keep a stone-pot of well-spiced vinegar by itself,
and put in a few at a time as you want them.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CUCUMBER AND ONION PICKLE</span></p>

<p>Take a dozen fine crisp cucumbers and four large
onions. Cut both in thick slices, sprinkle salt and
pepper on them, and let them stand. Next day drain
them well and scald them in boiling vinegar; cover
close after scalding. Next day scald again with a bag
of mace, nutmeg and ginger, in the vinegar; then place
them in jars and cork close. If the vinegar seems to
have lost its strength, replace with fresh, and put the
bag of spices in again to keep the flavor.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">OLD-TIME SWEET PICKLED CUCUMBERS</span></p>

<p>Put your cucumbers in brine for eight days; slice
them without soaking; let the slices be an inch thick.
When cut, soak them until the salt is nearly out,
changing the water very often. Then put them in a
kettle, with vine leaves laid between the layers;
cover them well with leaves, and sprinkle pulverized
alum all through them, to harden and green them, then
cover with vinegar, and set them on the back of the
stove until they become green. Take the cucumbers
out and boil them a little in ginger tea (half an hour
will be enough). Make a syrup of one quart of strong
vinegar, and one pint of water, three pounds of sugar
to four pounds of cucumbers, with one ounce of cinnamon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
cloves, mace and white ginger to every ten
pounds of fruit. Make this syrup hot, and put in the
cucumbers and boil them until clear. When they are
clear take them out and boil the syrup until it is thick
enough to keep. Pour it over the cucumbers, which
should have been placed in jars ready for the syrup.
They are now ready to use, or seal up, as may be
desired. If not convenient to pickle after eight days
salt brining, it does not hurt to let them remain a few
days longer.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PICKLED EGGS</span></p>

<p>When eggs are abundant and cheap, it is well to
pickle some for a time of scarcity. Boil three or four
dozen eggs for half an hour, let them cool, and then
take off the shells, and place them in wide-mouthed
jars, and pour over them scalding vinegar. Season
the vinegar with whole pepper, cloves, or allspice, ginger,
and a few cloves of garlic. When cold, they must
be bunged down very close. Let them be well covered
with the vinegar, and in a month they will be fit for
use. The above pickle is by no means expensive, and
as an accompaniment to cold meat is not to be surpassed
for piquancy and gout.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SWEET PICKLE OF FIGS</span></p>

<p>Put the figs in brine at night; in the morning, or
after being in brine about twelve hours, take them out,
wash off the salt, and put them in alum water for
three hours. Then take them out and scald them in
hot water until heated through. Make a syrup of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
quart of vinegar, a pint of sugar with a tablespoonful
of cinnamon, mace, and cloves each; boil half an hour,
and pour on the figs boiling hot. Repeat the boiling
next day, and bottle up and seal for future use.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SWEET PLUM PICKLE</span></p>

<p>Take eight pounds of fruit, four pounds of sugar,
two quarts of vinegar, one ounce of cinnamon and one
of cloves. Boil the vinegar, sugar and spices together;
skim it carefully and pour it boiling on the fruit; pour
it off, and skim and scald each day for three days;
it will then be fit for use. If for putting away, scald it
the fourth time and cork up tightly. Plums prepared
in this way are superior to the old way, with
sugar alone.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">GREEN TOMATO SWEET PICKLE</span></p>

<p>Slice tomatoes until you have seven pounds, sprinkle
them with salt, and let them stand twenty-four hours.
Then soak them for the same length of time in fresh
water to get the brine from them. When drained off
and ready, allow four and a half pounds of sugar, one
ounce of cinnamon, one ounce of cloves, and enough
vinegar to cover them. Boil the compound together
and pour it over the tomatoes; let them stand twenty-four
hours, then bring all to a boil, and tie away in
jars, and keep in a cool place away from the light.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CANTALOUPE SWEET PICKLE</span></p>

<p>Take a ripe cantaloupe, quarter it, remove the seeds
and cut it into pieces an inch square. Put the cut
pieces in a stone crock, and pour on scalding vinegar;
when it cools heat it again, and return it to the cantaloupe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
Repeat this next day. On the fourth day
take out the fruit and add fresh vinegar to cover it.
To every quart of this vinegar add three pounds of
loaf sugar, and five pounds of cantaloupe. Put to
them nutmeg, cinnamon and mace, to taste. Put all
in a porcelain-lined kettle and simmer until the fruit
can be pierced with a straw. Pack it in small jars
and keep in a cool place.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHOPPED CABBAGE PICKLE</span></p>

<p>Put together one pint of chopped onions, three gills
(or three wineglassfuls) of white mustard seed, three
tablespoonfuls of ground mustard and the same of
celery seed; add a pound of brown sugar and three
quarts of good vinegar. Cook this compound slowly
until it begins to thicken, then pour it hot upon two
gallons of chopped cabbage, which should be shaved or
chopped very thin. This pickle is ready to bottle for
use when it has boiled fifteen minutes.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO PICKLE CABBAGE. A VERY NICE YELLOW PICKLE</span></p>

<p>Cut four cabbage heads into eighths, if large, or
quarters, if small; they must be white and tender.
Soak it in strong brine for three days and scald it in
clear water until you can pierce it with a straw. Take
it out and dry it on large dishes for twenty-four hours.
Then put it into strong vinegar, with powdered turmeric,
sufficient to color the cabbage yellow. Let it
remain in this vinegar ten days; then take it out and
drain on a sieve for several hours. Have the following
spices prepared, then pack in a jar alternately one
layer of cabbage and one of spices. For each gallon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
of vinegar allow five pounds of sugar, three ounces of
turmeric, two of ginger, four of horseradish, two of
white mustard seed, one-half ounce of celery seed,
quarter of an ounce of mace, two ounces of whole pepper,
white if you can get it, and four ounces of garlic.
Scald the vinegar and sugar together, and pour hot on
the cabbage and the spices. Cover tight, and you will
have an admirable pickle.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO PICKLE RED CABBAGE</span></p>

<p>Slice the cabbage and sprinkle with salt. Let it
remain three days; drain, and pour over it boiling
vinegar in which you have put mace, bruised ginger,
whole pepper and cloves; let it remain in this until
next day. Then give one more scald, and it is ready
to put up for use. The purple red cabbage is the best.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHOW-CHOW PICKLE</span></p>

<p>Take a quarter of a peck each, of green tomatoes,
pickling-beans, and white onions (scald the onions
separately), add one dozen cucumbers, green peppers,
and a head of cabbage chopped. Season with ground
mustard, celery seed, and salt to taste. Pour over
these the best cider vinegar to cover them, and let all
boil two hours, and while hot add two tablespoonfuls
of sweet oil and the same of white sugar. Bottle and
seal up carefully in wide-mouthed glass jars.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PICKLED CAULIFLOWER</span></p>

<p>Take large, ripe, full-blown cauliflowers; divide the
pieces equally and throw them into a kettle of boiling
water; boil them until a little soft, but not as much as
if for the table. Take the pieces out and let them cool,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
then scald an ounce of mace, to each quart of good
cider vinegar, and pour it hot on the cauliflower.
Spices such as are usually used in pickling, improve
this recipe, and should be tied in a bag and thrown in
with the pickle at the last, remembering not to use
dark spices, as they discolor the cauliflower. White
pepper, white mustard seed and ginger are the spices
suitable for this pickle.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PICKLED LEMONS</span></p>

<p>They should be small and have a thick rind. Rub
them hard with a piece of flannel, then slit them
through the rind in four quarters, but not through the
pulp; fill the slits with salt hard pressed in, set them
upright in a crock four or five days, until the salt
melts. Turn them each day in their own liquid until
they get tender. Make the pickle to cover them of
vinegar, some of the brine of the lemons, pepper and
ginger; boil this pickle and skim it well, and when cold
put it over the lemons with two ounces of mustard seed
and two cloves of garlic, to six lemons. This is fine
for fish when the lemons are all used.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO PICKLE ONIONS</span></p>

<p>Peel the onions, boil some strong salt and water and
put it over them, cover, and let them stand twenty-four
hours, then take them up with a skimmer; make some
vinegar boiling hot, put to it whole pepper and mustard
seed, and pour it over the onions to cover them;
when cold cover close.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PREMIUM MUSTARD PICKLE</span></p>

<p>Soak three quarts of small cucumbers, gherkins, or
green tomatoes, in strong salt water for three days;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
then put them into fresh cold water for a day or two,
then scald them in plain vinegar and set them by in a
place to cool. Take a gallon of vinegar, add to it one
ounce of white mustard seed, two ounces of turmeric,
three of sliced ginger, two of shredded horseradish,
one-half pound of mustard, three pounds of brown
sugar, one-half pint of sweet oil, one ounce each of
celery seed, black pepper, cloves, mace, and one teaspoonful
of cayenne pepper. Boil all these ingredients
for fifteen minutes and pour it on the cucumbers,
gherkins, or other scalded vegetable you may wish to
pickle.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">WALNUT PICKLE</span></p>

<p>Pick the walnuts about the Fourth of July. They
should be so soft that a pin can be run through them.
Lay them in salt and water ten days, change the water
two or three times during the ten days. Rub off the
outside with a coarse cloth and proceed to finish the
pickle. For one hundred nuts, make a pickle of two
quarts of vinegar, one ounce of ground pepper, same
of ginger, half an ounce of mace, cloves, nutmegs and
mustard seed. Put these spices in a bag, lay it in the
vinegar and boil all together a few minutes; then set
the pickle away for use. If the vinegar is not very
strong, add fresh vinegar to the last scalding of the
pickles.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PICKLED OYSTERS</span></p>

<p>Take fine large oysters, put them over a gentle fire in
their own liquor, and a small lump of butter to each
hundred oysters. Let them boil ten minutes, when
they are plump and white; take them from their liquor
with a skimmer and spread them on a thickly folded
cloth. When they are firm and cold take half as much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
of their own liquor and half of good vinegar, make this
hot, and take a stone crock, put in a layer of oysters, a
spoonful of ground mace, a dozen cloves, allspice, and
whole pepper alternately. If to be kept, put them in
glass jars with a little sweet oil on top. Stop them
and seal tight, and they will, if kept in a cool place, be
good for months.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">COUNTRY GREEN PICKLE</span></p>

<p>One peck of tomatoes, eight green peppers to be
chopped fine. They must be the vegetable or sweet
pepper. Soak the tomatoes and pepper twenty-four
hours in weak brine; drain off the brine, and add to
the green tomatoes a head of finely chopped cabbage;
scald all in boiling vinegar twenty minutes. Skim it
out from the vinegar, and place in a large jar, and add
three pints of grated horseradish and such other spices
as you please. Fill the jars with strong cold vinegar
and tie up for use.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TOMATO SAUCE PICKLE</span></p>

<p>One gallon of tomatoes and one gallon of vinegar.
Slice the tomatoes (green ones are firmest), and
sprinkle salt between each layer. Let them remain thus
for twelve hours, then rinse them, and put them to
drain on a sieve. Put your vinegar to boil with a
dozen onions cut up in it, season high with cloves, pepper
and ginger, and when this boils throw in your
tomatoes and let them boil five minutes. Finish by
stirring in one-quarter of a pound of mustard and a
pound of sugar; then add a quart of vinegar and bottle
it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PLAIN PEACH PICKLE</span></p>

<p>Take eight or ten fine, nearly ripe peaches; free-stone
are preferred by some, but experience teaches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
that clings make the firmest pickle. Wipe off the
down with a flannel rag, and put them into brine
strong enough to bear up an egg. In two days drain
them from this brine, and scald them in boiling vinegar,
and let them stay in all night. Next day boil in
a quart of vinegar, one ounce of whole pepper, one of
broken-up ginger, eight blades of mace, and two ounces
of mustard-seed; pour this boiling on the peaches, and
when cool, put them in jars, and pack away carefully
in a cool place.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PEACH PICKLES</span></p>

<p>Take ripe, sound, cling-stone peaches; remove the
down with a brush like a clothes brush; make a gallon
of good vinegar hot; add to it four pounds of brown
sugar; boil and skim it clear. Stick five or six cloves
into each of the peaches, then pour the hot vinegar
over them, cover the vessel and set it in a cold place
for eight or ten days, then drain off the vinegar, make
it hot, skim it, and again turn it over the peaches; let
them become cold, then put them into glass jars and
secure as directed for preserves. Free-stone peaches
may be used.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PEACHES AND APRICOT PICKLE</span></p>

<p>Take peaches fully grown, but not mellow; cover
them in strong salt and water for one week. Take
them from the brine and wipe them carefully, rubbing
each peach to see if it is firm. Put to a gallon of vinegar
half an ounce each of cloves, pepper corns, sliced
ginger root, white mustard seed, and a little salt.
Scald the peaches with this boiling vinegar, repeat this
three times; add half as much fresh vinegar, and cork
them up in jars. Keep them dark and cool. Light
will spoil pickles or preserves as much as heat does.
Apricots may be pickled in the same way.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">GREEN PEACHES PICKLED</span></p>

<p>Brush the down from green peaches (cling-stones);
put them in salt and water, with grape leaves and a bit
of saleratus; set them over a moderate fire to simmer
slowly until they are a fine green, then take them out,
wipe them dry, and smooth the skins; take enough vinegar
to cover them, put to it whole pepper, allspice, and
mustard seed, making it boiling hot, and turn it over
the peaches. Repeat the scalding three successive days.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PEACH MANGOES</span></p>

<p>Steep some large free-stone peaches in brine for two
days, then wipe each peach carefully, and cut a hole in
it just sufficient to allow the seed to come out; then
throw them into cold vinegar until you make the stuffing,
which is to fill up the cavity occupied by the seed.
Take fresh white mustard seed which has been wet with
vinegar, and allowed to swell a few hours, scraped
horseradish, powdered ginger, a few pods of red pepper,
a few small onions, or, better still, a clove of garlic.
Mix all with vinegar, and add half as much chopped
peach. Stuff the peaches hard with this mixture, replace
the piece cut out, and tie it up tight with pack-thread.
Boil a quart of vinegar for each dozen peaches;
season it with the same spices as the stuffing. Boil the
spices in a small bag, and then put in the peaches and
let them scald ten or fifteen minutes, just long enough
to be thoroughly hot all through. Place the peaches in
jars, and pour scalding vinegar well spiced over them—the
vinegar must cover them; add at the top a tablespoonful
of salad oil. Cover the jar tight by tying
leather over it.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">MELON MANGOES</span></p>

<p>Get the late, small, smooth, green melons, they
should not be larger than a teacup; cut out a piece
from the stem end large enough to allow you to take
the seeds from the inside; scrape out all the soft part,
and when done, cover with the piece cut out and lay
them in rows in a stone or wooden vessel as you do
them. Make a strong brine of salt and water, pour it
over the melons and let them remain in it twenty-four
hours. Prepare the following stuffing: sliced horseradish,
very small cucumbers, nasturtiums, small white
onions, mustard seed, whole pepper, cloves and allspice;
scald the pickles and cull them. Rinse the melons
in cold water, then wipe each one dry and fill it.
Put a cucumber, one or two small onions, with sliced
horseradish and mustard seed, into each melon; put
on the piece belonging to it and sew it with a coarse
needle and thread; lay them in a stone pot or wooden
vessel, the cut side up; when all are in, strew over
them cloves and pepper, make the vinegar (enough to
cover them) boiling hot, and put it over them, then
cover with a folded towel; let them stand one night,
then drain off the vinegar, make it hot again and pour
it on, covering as before. Repeat this scalding four
or five times, until the mangoes are a fine green; three
times is generally enough. Be sure the melons are
green and freshly gathered. The proper sort are the
last on the vines, green and firm. If you wish to keep
them till the next summer, choose the most firm, put in
a jar and cover with cold fresh vinegar; tie thick
paper over them.

</div>
<hr class="medium">

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">REMARKS ON YEAST</span></p>

<p>Without good yeast to start with it is impossible to
make good bread, therefore I devote a few moments to
this important consideration. There are several kinds
of yeast used for raising bread and rolls. Brewers’
yeast is given to start with, though too strong for a
family bread. Bakers’ is better, but not always to be
had. A housekeeper should get a little of any good
yeast to commence with, and when she finds it is good,
and is well risen and sweet, instead of pouring it into
flour, and baking it, it is better to thicken it with cornmeal,
cut the cakes out, dry in a cool place, and keep
the cakes always on hand for any purpose to which
they are suited, <i>i. e.</i>, in the making of bread, rolls,
pocketbooks, loaf, cake, sally lunn, or any kind of light
biscuit.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO MAKE RISING WITH YEAST CAKE</span></p>

<p>Take a heaping spoonful of good yeast cake pounded,
one-half a cup of warm water, a lump of sugar, and
enough sifted flour to make a thick batter. Set this to
rise in a cool place in summer, and a warm place in
winter. It will be light and ready to use in about three
hours, unless it is kept very cool. A heaping spoonful
is the proper quantity for one quart of flour; half a
cup of lard will make the bread better and richer. It is
well to grease the bread on top before baking.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">TURNPIKE CAKES, COMMONLY CALLED HARD YEAST</span></p>

<p>Put a cup of hops into a pint of water; when boiling
hot, strain it over a pint of corn-meal; add a teacup of
bakers’ yeast, and when cool roll the dough in flour,
and cut it out into cakes, and dry them for use.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LIQUID YEAST OF PARCHED CORN AND HOPS, WHICH DOES
NOT TURN SOUR</span></p>

<p>Take two teacupfuls of corn, parch it thoroughly,
being careful not to burn it; add a good handful of
hops; boil in water enough to cover well, for an hour
and a half. Pare six good-sized potatoes, and boil
them for half an hour with the corn and hops. Sift the
potatoes (when done) through a colander, and strain
the liquor through a cloth onto the potatoes; add a
tablespoonful of vinegar, one cup of sugar, and a half
cup of salt; put in cold water enough to make up a
gallon. Put the whole in a jug, having added a teacupful
of good yeast to raise it. Set the jug, without corking,
in a warm place till it begins to “work,” then cork
it and put it in the cellar, and the longer it stands the
better it becomes. When wanted for bread, you should
(at noon) take five or six boiled potatoes, mash them
very fine, stir in a teacupful of flour, and pour on a
quart of boiling water; then put in a cup nearly full of
yeast, and set the ferment in a warm place till night;
then set a soft sponge, with warm water and flour, adding
the ferment; it will be ready to mould up hard the
first thing in the morning. Let it rise till quite light,
then mould it out in loaves, rise again, and bake in the
usual way. The sponge should not be set near the stove.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
The superior qualities of this yeast are shown by the
fact that you never use saleratus in the bread, and it
never sours. If the directions are followed, with good
flour, you may be sure of sweet light bread every time.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MISS BEECHER’S POTATO YEAST</span></p>

<p>Mash six boiled potatoes, mix in half a coffeecup of
flour, two teaspoonfuls of salt, and add hot water until
it is a batter; beat all well together. When it is blood-warm
add to it one-half cup of brewers’ yeast, or a
whole cup of home-brewed yeast. When this is light,
put it in a bottle, and cork it tight for use. Keep it as
cool as possible.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ANOTHER POTATO YEAST WITHOUT HOPS</span></p>

<p>Boil and mash sufficient potatoes to fill a pint cup;
add to them a pint of water, boil them together, stir in
flour enough to form a thick batter, and when cool, add
a yeast cake, or a cup of good yeast. Bottle and put
away in a cool place.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">YEAST WITH HOPS</span></p>

<p>Peel and boil eight large Irish potatoes. Boil a handful
of hops in a little water, or in the water the potatoes
were boiled in; mash the potatoes fine, and strain
the water from the hops over them. Put in a cup of
flour to the potatoes before the water is poured on, as
it mixes better when dry; mix all together and beat it,
then put in half a cup of good yeast, or a yeast cake.
This will keep good for a week if kept cool.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">HOME-MADE YEAST</span></p>

<p>Boil one pound of good flour, one-quarter of a pound
of good sugar, and a tablespoonful of salt in two gallons
of water. Boil for two hours, and bottle it for use.
This will do if you are where you cannot get bakers’
yeast, or turnpike cakes to start your yeast, but is not
always reliable.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SALT RISING YEAST</span></p>

<p>Take a pint of new milk, warm from the cow if possible.
Put in a teaspoonful of salt, and thicken it with
flour to the consistency of batter cakes. Set this in a
warm place to rise, and make your biscuit or bread up
with it, and some new milk, or milk and water warmed
together.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SALT, OR MILK, RISING FOR BREAD, AND HOW TO BAKE IT</span></p>

<p>Take a pint of new milk, stir in nearly a pint of boiling
water, then salt it with a teaspoonful of fine salt;
thicken this with flour enough to make a thick batter.
Set it in a warm place to rise, and it is ready to mix
into bread. Mix the yeast in a soft dough with fine
flour, a little lard, and a cup of water; mould it, and
set it to rise. When well risen, bake it a nice brown.
Wrap it in a damp cloth for a few minutes, and let it
cool slowly before it is cut. This is a good bread for a
delicate stomach, which is sometimes painfully affected
by hop-yeast bread.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">HARD FIG-LEAF YEAST MADE WITHOUT HOPS</span></p>

<p>During the war we could get no hops, and found that
fig-leaves were a good substitute. <em>To Make Fig-Leaf
Yeast.</em>—Take a pint cup of the leaves, put them to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
quart of cold water, and boil them until a strong tea or
decoction is made—this is to be put away to cool; then
pour off the tea carefully, leaving the dregs and leaves.
Now boil and wash Irish potatoes enough to fill a pint-cup,
put them to the tea of fig-leaves, beat them up with
a tablespoonful of brown sugar and flour, to make a stiff
batter, and put it in a covered vessel to rise. When this
yeast is light and frothing, thicken it immediately (as
keeping too long injures it) with corn-meal, until it is
thick enough to be rolled out like biscuit. Roll it out,
cut and dry the cake, turning them very often until dry.
This will be a supply of yeast for several months. When
you wish to make bread, take one of the cakes in the
morning, put it in a covered mug or pitcher; put on it a
cup of cold water, and when it is dissolved, put to it a
spoonful of brown sugar, and make a batter of the water
and yeast cake. Make this batter as stiff as pound-cake
batter, and when it rises well, mix with two quarts
of flour, and the bread will be most excellent, if carefully
made according to these directions. Use lard as
usual in making the bread up for baking.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO MAKE A LOAF OF GOOD BREAD</span></p>

<p>One large spoonful of hop yeast, or a yeast cake; put
this to a pint of water, mash to this two Irish potatoes,
and stir all together. Sift in flour until you have a stiff
batter, and set it to rise. When it is very light, stir in
a spoonful of lard, and enough flour to enable you to
mould it into a loaf. When moulded, grease the top, and
set it to rise again. If really light, you can now bake
it; but if <em>not</em>, work it down again, and mould it over and
let it rise again. This is made plain and definite, for
nothing is more discouraging for a young housekeeper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
than to feel that she really <em>tried</em>, and yet could <em>not</em> make
good bread. This is in such small quantities that a
young person could try it, without feeling that she was
wasting much, if she does not succeed the first time.
Any one who tries this simple recipe will have the pleasure
of presenting a nice loaf of bread to her family.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO MAKE GOOD BREAD</span></p>

<p>Make a pint of meal into mush, then pour it onto
two quarts of flour; when cool, add a little salt and
warm water, or milk, and a cup of yeast; work it with
a spoon, and set it by to rise until morning. Knead it
well; yes, <em>very</em> well, and make it into loaves; place in
the pan, and when light, bake it. Add a little lard, if
liked.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">A VERY NICE POTATO BREAD</span></p>

<p>To two pounds or pints of flour, add one pound or
pint of warm, mashed mealy Irish potatoes. Add to
this milk and water, a cup of yeast and a little salt.
Make it after kneading it very well, into loaves, and
place them in a pan to rise. If you desire a rich, short
bread you may add a little lard or butter, but it is
nice without.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">RAISED WHEAT BREAD WITH POTATOES</span></p>

<p>Take one half a cup of hop yeast, or yeast made from
turnpike cake will do, also two boiled hot Irish potatoes,
mash them, and add to the yeast and potatoes
one pint of water. Make a sponge of this by beating
in sifted flour until it is a soft dough. Set it to rise
by the stove; when it is light, pour the sponge in the
bread tray and mould it rather stiff with sifted flour,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
knead it well and set it to rise <em>again</em>. When it is light,
work in a little more flour, shape it in loaves in the
baking-pans; and when light the second time bake it;
this allows the yeast to lighten or rise <em>once</em>, and the
dough or bread to rise twice, making three fermentations
the dough undergoes before it is baked into bread.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LIGHT BREAD, INVARIABLY GOOD</span></p>

<p>Take <em>nine</em> pint cups of flour, one pint cup of good
yeast made from hops, two pint cups of warm water
and a pint cupful of warm milk. Make into a sponge,
let this rise; when risen, knead it with all your
strength, work more flour into it, and let it rise again.
When it is light, you must bake it in loaves.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">EXCELLENT FAMILY BREAD</span></p>

<p>Take a peck of sifted flour, half a pint of family
yeast, or a gill of brewers’ yeast; wet all up soft with
new milk, or milk and water warm. Add a cup of
shortening, and a teaspoonful of salt. Knead it faithfully,
and set it in a warm place to rise. It is better
to take the dough when risen, and work it down again;
but some dislike the trouble, and bake it as soon as it
rises. You must keep your dough for wheat bread
very soft; but for rye, you may have it stiff.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SPONGE BREAD</span></p>

<p>Take three quarts of wheat flour, and three quarts
of boiling water, mix them thoroughly; let them remain
until lukewarm, then add twelve spoonfuls of
family yeast, or six of brewers’. Place it where it will
be warm; keep the air from it, and leave it to rise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
When it is light, work in flour to mould it, and a little
salt. Let it stand for a second rising, then shape into
loaves and bake.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">RYE AND INDIAN BREAD FOR DYSPEPTICS</span></p>

<p>Take a pint of rye flour and a pint of Indian meal,
scald the meal with a cup of boiling water, and when
lukewarm, mix in the flour and a cup of yeast; add a
little salt, and knead it as for other bread. Bake for
two hours.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">GRAHAM BREAD</span></p>

<p>Get good, fresh, ground unbolted flour, and sift it
through a common hair sieve. Take three quarts of
this wheat meal, one half a cup of good yeast, and three
spoonfuls of molasses. Mix to a sponge with water,
work in flour enough to mould it, and proceed as you do
with common wheat bread. You must put a little soda
in the batter before moulding, as it is more disposed
to ferment than fine or bolted flour.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MISS SHATTUCK’S BROWN BREAD</span></p>

<p>One quart of rye meal, two quarts of Indian meal, two
tablespoonfuls of molasses; mix thoroughly with sweet
milk. Let it stand two hours, and bake in a slow oven.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BOSTON BROWN BREAD</span></p>

<p>One and a half pints of Indian meal, half a pint of
wheat flour, one cup of sweet milk, one cup of sour milk,
with a teaspoonful of soda in it; three tablespoonfuls of
molasses, one tablespoonful of yeast, and a pinch of
salt. Put it in a warm place to rise, then let it bake
steadily for four hours; warm by steaming it when
wanted to use.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">CORN BATTER BREAD</span></p>

<p>Take six spoonfuls of flour, and six of corn meal; add
a little salt, sift them together; make a batter with four
eggs, and a cup of milk; stir in the flour and meal, make
it a soft batter, and bake in small tins for breakfast.
Some use yeast powder or soda with this batter, but
that is a matter of taste. If yeast powder is used, sift
it in the flour; if soda is used put it in the milk.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MISSISSIPPI CORN BREAD</span></p>

<p>One quart of buttermilk, two eggs, three spoonfuls of
butter, and a teaspoonful of saleratus; stir in meal, to
the milk, until it is as thick as buckwheat batter. Bake
in squares about one inch thick. It will require half an
hour in a hot oven. If it is not nice, it will be because
you have put in too much meal, and made the batter too
thick. But try again, and you will succeed.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SODA OR MILK BISCUIT</span></p>

<p>To a pound of sifted flour, put the yolk of an egg; dissolve
a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda in a little milk;
put it and a teaspoonful of salt to the flour, with as
much milk as will make a stiff paste; work it well together,
beat it for some minutes with a rolling-pin, then
roll it very thin. Cut it in round or square biscuits,
and bake in a moderate oven until they are crisp.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">RICH SODA BISCUITS WITH CREAM OF TARTAR</span></p>

<p>To each quart of flour add two teaspoonfuls of cream

of water, pour it on the flour; mix with milk, or milk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
and water, to a soft dough, roll out on the floured biscuit
board, cut with the biscuit cutter, and bake quickly.
Add a little salt.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">A NICE WAY TO MAKE YEAST POWDER BISCUIT</span></p>

<p>Take a quart of flour—which is about the quantity required
by an ordinary family of six persons; sift one
pint of the flour in a tin basin, and sift into it two heaping
spoonfuls of yeast or baking powder. Add to the
flour a tablespoonful of lard; put this also in the basin
and make, with a little salt, a nice batter; beat the flour,
lard and water very briskly until it is light. Take down
your biscuit board and sift on it the other pint of flour,
make a hole in the flour, and pour in your batter, gently
stirring it until it is a soft dough; keep it as soft as
possible, roll it out, cut it with the biscuit cutter, and
bake quickly. These biscuits never have that screwed
or drawn-up look that most biscuits made with yeast
powder have.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SPONGE BISCUIT WITH YEAST</span></p>

<p>Stir half a teacup of melted butter, a teaspoonful of
salt and a cup of good yeast, into a pint of lukewarm
water; then add flour to make a stiff batter. Set this
to rise; when light drop this mixture onto flat buttered
tins; drop them several inches apart so as to leave room
for them to rise. Let them stay in a warm place fifteen
minutes, before being put in the oven to bake. Bake
them quickly to a light brown color; they will take
about six or eight hours to lighten, though the time
depends always on the yeast, and the coldness or
warmth of the weather.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">SPONGE BISCUIT WITHOUT YEAST, MADE WITH CREAM</span></p>

<p>Mix half a pint of thick cream, four eggs, a little salt,
soda, and flour enough to make a stiff batter; if too stiff
to drop nicely, thin it with a cup of sweet milk. Drop
on tins like the above recipe. Bake in a quick oven.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CREAM OF TARTAR BISCUIT FOR BREAKFAST</span></p>

<p>One quart of sifted flour, three teaspoonfuls of cream

and water, to form a dough; work it and set it to rise.
When it has risen, take down your bread-board, flour it
<em>well</em>, roll your dough out on the board, and spread over
it a tablespoonful of lard or butter. Sprinkle a dust of
flour over the butter, roll it up into rolls and bake
quickly. Rolls are often made dark by allowing them
to get too light.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">VIRGINIA ROLLS</span></p>

<p>One tablespoonful of good yeast, one egg, one large
spoonful of butter, one pound or pint of flour, a little
salt and enough milk to form into a stiff batter. Set it
to rise in a warmed pan until it is light; sift a cup of
flour into the bread-tray, and pour the light batter in;
work it well and keep the dough very soft, which is the
most certain way to have light rolls or bread. Now,
that it is well worked, moist and soft, set the dough to
rise; when light, make into rolls, and lay them on a
warmed and buttered pan; set them by the fire to rise
again, baste the top over with butter, and bake in a
quick oven as soon as they are light. Do not keep
them too long rising or they might become sharp or
sour.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LIGHT FLOUR PUFFS FOR BREAKFAST</span></p>

<p>Take a tumbler of sifted flour, a tumbler of milk and

together, and add a teaspoonful of melted butter or lard
just before baking in little fancy pans. Put salt in the
flour with the yeast powder, and then bake as quickly

well, and pour into a warm and well greased cake pan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
and set it to rise in a warm place in winter, and a cool
one in summer. If you wish it for tea, make it up five
hours beforehand, having set the yeast to rise after
breakfast. If wanted for breakfast make it up at nine
o’clock the night before. Remember if made up at
night, you add a little more flour, or make the dough a
little stiffer, and do not put it in a pan at night, but
allow it to rise in a tureen or crock, and pour it in the
pan and let it rise a little before baking. It must be
baked like a cake. This is a never failing recipe and
has been much liked.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS WITH YEAST</span></p>

<p>Take two pints of milk, four eggs, and a small teacupful
of yeast, or a yeast cake; melt a piece of butter (the
size of an egg) in a little of the milk, add a teaspoonful
of salt, and thicken with sifted flour until it is like buckwheat
batter. Set it to rise for eight or ten hours, and
then bake in muffin rings, or pour it like batter cakes, on
a hot griddle. Butter them, when cooked this way, just

must flour the board and roll out the dough half an inch

<p>Take one pound of powdered or flour sugar (not the
common pulverized) and the whites of four eggs. Put
the sugar to the eggs before you beat it at all; then beat
till it is stiff. Spread it on the cake with a wet knife,
wetting it in cold water each time you use it. Set it in
front of the stove to dry, or in an oven with the least
particle of heat. The cake must be nearly cold. You
can flavor the icing with rose, orange, or lemon; if the
latter, add a very small portion of grated rind. It is
much nicer to add sugar to eggs before beating than
afterward.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHOCOLATE ICING</span></p>

<p>To one pound of fine loaf sugar add half a pint of
cold water; boil over a brisk fire until the sugar, when
pressed with the fingers, presents the appearance of
strong glue; add six ounces of grated chocolate; flavor
with vanilla.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO MAKE ICING FOR CAKES</span></p>

<p>Beat the whites of two eggs to a froth, then add to
them a quarter of a pound of white sugar, ground fine
like flour; flavor with extract of lemon or vanilla; beat
it until it is light and very white, the longer it is beaten
the firmer it will become. No more sugar must be
added to make it so. Beat the frosting until it may be
spread smoothly on the cake. This quantity will ice
quite a large cake over the top and the sides.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">FROSTING FOR CAKE</span></p>

<p>To each egg used take ten teaspoonfuls of finest powdered
sugar, and a teaspoonful of lemon extract. Beat
quickly, and allow at least five minutes for each spoonful
of sugar. The excellence of icing depends on the
purity of the powdered sugar and the rapidity of beating
given the eggs; it is much to be regretted that the
most of powdered sugar is adulterated with foreign
materials, especially with the white earth called “Terra
Alba,” which causes the sugar to harden like stone,
and prevents the cake and frosting from being, as it
should be, light and good.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BOILED ICING. VERY NICE</span></p>

<p>Boil until very thick, a pound of white sugar in a cup
of water. It should be as thick as for candy; when
boiled, pour it gently on the beaten whites of three
eggs. Beat this rapidly until well mixed with the eggs,
then flour the cake with flour or corn starch, and ice it
with a knife in the usual way. You must use flavoring
to suit your taste. Much of the perfection of icing
depends on the quality of the sugar, which should be
pure and ground, not pulverized, as that sugar is now
often adulterated.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">HOT BOILED ICING FOR CAKE</span></p>

<p>Dissolve one pint of powdered sugar in two large

a strong froth, take off the boiling syrup, and beat it
to the white of eggs, holding it high over the pans, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
pouring it in a stream on the eggs; then flavor with
lemon, or vanilla, and spread it on the cake, while the

all, beat in the flour with the powder in it. Bake
quickly in square or jelly cake pans.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">YOUNG COOKS’ JELLY ROLL</span></p>

<p>Make the sponge for your jelly roll by taking a cup
of white sugar, one cup of flour, and three eggs. Mix,
etc.; add baking powder with the flour. Bake in a
stewpan with a quick fire; turn the cake out on a towel
when done; spread the jelly while it is still warm and
soft, and roll it carefully. Cut it in slices when cold;
a spoonful of water beaten with the eggs makes the
cake lighter, as it breaks the tissue of the eggs if it is
added to them when beaten up.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ALMOND DROPS</span></p>

<p>Blanch and pound five ounces of sweet, and three
ounces of bitter almonds (or peach kernels), with a
little white of egg. Put half a pound of sifted flour on
your dough board, make a hole in the middle of the
flour, in which put the almonds, with a pound of sugar,
four yolks of eggs, and a little salt. Make into a paste.
Cut in pieces the size of a nut, lay them half an inch
apart, on sheets of paper, in a baking-pan, and bake
in a moderate oven for fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Blanch and pound with a little rose-water half a
pound of almonds; add half a pound of sifted sugar,
the whites of two eggs (not beaten), form into a paste.
Dip your hand in water, and roll the preparation into
balls the size of a nutmeg; lay them an inch apart, on
buttered paper, in a baking tin. Bake in a slow oven
until a light brown.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ALMOND MACAROONS</span></p>

<p>To a pound of the best white sugar, sifted, add a
pound of blanched almonds; put in a few drops of rose-water
as you beat them together in a mortar. Add to
them the well-beaten whites of six eggs, and form the
paste into shapes in the palm of the hand by using a
little flour; butter some sheets of white paper, and
drop the macaroons on it, leaving a space between
them. Strew a little white sugar on them, and put in
the oven to bake a light brown. Almonds are blanched
by pouring hot water on them, and slipping off the
brown coating.

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHARLOTTE RUSSE IN VARIOUS WAYS</span></p>

<p>There are many varieties of this Charlotte. They
are always similarly made, that is with sponge cake or
lady fingers, and whipped cream, custard or blanc-mange.
One way is to beat the whites of three eggs
to a high froth, with a quarter of a pound of sugar,
and half a pint of cream, until it is quite thick and
light; flavor this to your taste with lemon or vanilla,
and pour it into a cake-lined mould; place some of the
sliced cake or lady fingers on top of the mould and over
the cream; set it on ice, and when wanted turn it on
a dish and serve.</p>

<p>Or, having lined a basin or mould, or small tin cups
with any convenient cake, such as lady fingers, sliced
savoy cake, or yellow lady cake, fill them with mock
cream, blanc-mange or custard, made from the yolks
of eggs; let them become cold, then turn them out and
serve.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ANOTHER WAY</span></p>

<p>Break an ounce of isinglass small, and pour on it a
teacup of hot milk or water; let it dissolve, then strain
it through muslin, on half a pound of fine white sugar.
When nearly cold add to it a quart of rich cream, already
beaten to a froth; continue to beat it for a few
minutes, holding the pan on ice. Line your mould with
sponges and pour your cream in. Cover with sponge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
cake or lady fingers. Turn it out and serve. The
isinglass will make this very firm if held on ice long
enough to solidify before serving.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PLAIN CHARLOTTE RUSSE</span></p>

<p>Boil one ounce of isinglass in a pint of water until
reduced one-half. While it is boiling, make a custard
of one-half pint of milk, yolks of four eggs, and one-fourth
of a pound of sugar; flavor this with vanilla or
lemon. Take a quart of cream, whip it up to a fine
froth, and when the isinglass is nearly cold, so that it
will not curdle the cream, stir it and the cream into
the custard. Beat all thoroughly and set it on ice.
This is a nice, easy way to make this dish, and may be
made very ornamental, if wanted so, by lining a glass
dish with lady fingers, and then pouring in the cream
and laying fine fancy sugar-drops on top. If you have
no lady finger sponges, you can slice any light sponge
cake, and lay it on the bottom and sides of the glass
bowl.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SICILIAN BISCUIT DROPPED ON TINS</span></p>

<p>Take four eggs, twelve ounces of powdered and sifted
sugar, and ten ounces of flour. Beat the eggs and sugar
together in a stewpan on the fire, until the batter feels
warm to the touch; remove it from the fire, and stir it
thoroughly until it becomes cold; now add the flour,
and flavor with vanilla. Butter some paper and place
it on the baking tins, or pans. Drop the cake mixture
in round or ovals on the buttered paper, and bake in a
slow oven. When put in the oven sift white sugar over
the biscuit.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">QUEEN’S DROPS</span></p>

<p>Beat up a quarter of a pound of butter, and a quarter
of a pound of sifted sugar, two eggs, and six ounces of
flour. Flavor with almonds, or vanilla, or lemon. Butter
some paper, place it on baking-sheet or pans, and
drop the mixture in drops about the size of a nutmeg.
Bake in a hot oven.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ALMOND MERINGUE</span></p>

<p>Beat the whites of two eggs with a quarter of a
pound of powdered sugar and a quarter of a pound of
blanched and cut almonds. Form them into rings on
letter paper, put the paper on tin, and place them in
the stove oven, to harden and brown lightly.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">APPLE COMPOTE</span></p>

<p>Make a syrup of three-quarters of a pound of sugar
and a cup of water; let it boil while you are paring and
taking out the cores of six nice sour apples. Throw
them into the syrup and let them boil for half an hour,
or until transparent. Pour into a glass or china dish,
and serve for a lunch or tea. They are nice when served
warm.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MAIZENA BLANC MANGE</span></p>

<p>This can be made with maizena, corn starch, or potato
flour, but maizena is preferable. Take a quarter
of a pound of maizena and three pints of milk. Put
two and a half pints of the milk on to boil, and wet the
corn starch or maizena with the remaining half pint.
When the milk boils add to it (or better before it boils),
a quarter of a pound of white sugar and some lemon
rind, sliced or grated. Let this boil a little, and then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
stir in the mixed maizena or corn starch. When cooked
five minutes, pour it into moulds or bowls; wet the
bowls first with cold water to prevent the jelly sticking
to the sides. When firm and cold, eat it with cream
or any kind of stewed fruit you may have.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">GELATINE BLANC MANGE</span></p>

<p>To one quart of milk add an ounce of Nelson’s or
Coxe’s gelatine, which has been soaked an hour in a
cup of cold water. Add to this half a pound of fine
white sugar; let it simmer very gently on the fire in
a stewpan until all the gelatine is dissolved. Strain
it, and pour it in a mould; when it begins to thicken,
put it on ice and serve it with cream.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">GELATINE BLANC MANGE</span></p>

<p>Take a quart of new milk, set it on to boil; stir into
the boiling milk, half a box of gelatine, which should
have been soaked in cold water ten or fifteen minutes.
When the gelatine is dissolved, stir into the milk a cup
of sugar; take the jelly from the fire, and last of all
while the mixture is very hot, stir in four eggs; season
with vanilla or lemon extract, and pour into moulds.
Eat with cream. This is very nourishing for invalids.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHOCOLATE MANGE</span></p>

<p>Made the same as gelatine blanc mange above described,
except seasoning the jelly with six ounces of
grated chocolate in the boiling milk. Eat with cream
or wine sauce.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ISINGLASS JELLY</span></p>

<p>Boil in one pint of water, one ounce of isinglass, and
when well dissolved, add to it one pound of sugar, and
a cup of pale wine. When the water is boiling, add to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
it the rind of a lemon, and when taken off the fire, add
the juice and grated rind of lemon. Strain this mixture
and whisk it till it begins to thicken, then pour it
into the vessel you wish to mould it in, and set in a
cool place, or on ice, to harden.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LEMON CUSTARD</span></p>

<p>Boil a cup of water, and stir into it a tablespoonful
of flour, or corn starch. Beat the yolks of three eggs
with a cup of brown sugar. Add the juice of a lemon
strained; beat it up with the yolks and sugar. Pour
this in a paste, and bake it. While the custard is baking,
take the whites of the three eggs and beat them
up with a cup of pulverized sugar. Spread this icing
on the baked custard, and brown it slightly.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">NICE BOILED CUSTARD</span></p>

<p>To every quart of milk, allow six eggs and a cup of
white sugar. Set the milk to boil; beat the whites of
the eggs with a half cup of sugar, and drop into the
boiling milk for two minutes; then with a skimmer remove
the boiled whites, and put on a dish to cool. When
the whites are taken off, stir into the milk the yolks
and sugar, previously well beaten up together. Add
rose, lemon, or peach-leaf flavoring. Run this through
a sieve into the bowl you expect to serve it in; then
pile up the whites on the custard. The whites can be
boiled without beating them with sugar.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">APPLE CUSTARD. A NICE DISH</span></p>

<p>Take a dozen apples, a large cupful of brown sugar,
a teacupful of water, the grated rind of a lemon, one
pint of milk, four eggs, and two ounces of loaf sugar.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Peel, cut and core the apples; put them in a sauce-pan
with the water; as they heat, add the brown sugar and
lemon-peel. When mashed and well cooked, take it off;
put the fruit in the bottom of a deep dish, and pour a
custard of the milk, sugar and eggs, over it, and bake
in a moderate oven. Grate over it before baking, a
little nutmeg.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ALL THE YEAR ROUND PUDDING</span></p>

<p>Line a pie dish with paste, spread on this three
ounces of any kind of jam—strawberry or raspberry
is best. Then beat well in a basin three ounces of bread
crumbs, three ounces butter, and the same of sugar,
and the rind and juice of a large lemon; add this to
the pastry and jam, and bake half an hour. If the
lemon is not very juicy, add a tablespoonful of water
to it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO GLAZE PASTRY</span></p>

<p>Break an egg, separate the yolk from the white, and
beat it well; when the pastry is nearly baked take it
out of the oven and brush it over with this beaten yolk
of egg, then put it back in the oven to set the glaze.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TRANSPARENT PUDDING</span></p>

<p>Beat eight eggs very light; add them to half a pound
of butter, and the same of sugar, which have been
beaten to a cream together; grate in half a nutmeg,
set it on the fire in a stew-pan, and stir it constantly
until it is hot. Do not leave it more than five minutes
on the fire, as you only wish to slightly cook the whites
of the eggs to prevent their running when put on the
paste. Line two pie pans with delicate paste, and pour
in the mixture. Bake in a moderate oven, and do not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
allow the top to burn, as it will, if not covered when
first put in the oven. Cover with a pan until the bottom
is cooked, and then a few moments colors the top.
This pie has no meringue on top. Serve it with a tart
pie, as it is a very sweet dessert.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">APPLE TRIFLE—A SUPPER DISH</span></p>

<p>Make a marmalade by stewing tart apples in sugar,
seasoned with lemon. Lay it when cold in a deep glass
dish, pour over it a boiled custard made of two eggs,
half a pint of milk, sweetened with half a cup of sugar.
Finish it by whipping a pint of rich cream to a froth,
and pile it high on the custard. Ornament with strips
of citron and apple jelly laid on the whipped cream.
This is a charming dish for the country, where cream
is abundant.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TRIFLES. DELICIOUS</span></p>

<p>Cover the bottom of a glass bowl, or dish, with lady
fingers; break up, and put also half dozen macaroons;
pour over them a cup of wine, or diluted extract, to
moisten them; then put in three tablespoonfuls of jelly
or jam. Pour over this a boiled custard, made with a
pint of milk, three eggs and a cup of white sugar. Whip
up the whites of two eggs with a cup of white sugar and
lemon juice to taste, and when it will stand alone, put
it on the custard, and serve.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">GELATINE SNOW PUDDING</span></p>

<p>Take two tablespoonfuls of good gelatine, throw over
it two spoonfuls of water, let it soak ten minutes, then
pour over it half a pint of boiling water, three-quarters
of a pound of white sugar, and the juice of two lemons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
with the rind thrown in. Let it come to a boil, take it
off immediately, strain it, let it cool a little, and when it
begins to thicken add the beaten whites of two eggs.
Beat all thoroughly, and pour it in a mould on ice to
get firm. When cold and firm, send it to table in the
middle of a glass basin or dish, and pour around it a
custard made from the yolks of the eggs, and a pint of
milk sweetened and flavored to taste. Sponge cake
should be served with this pudding.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">A PRETTY DISH OF ORANGES CROQUANTE</span></p>

<p>Take ten or a dozen oranges, remove the peel, all the
white part and the seeds. Do this carefully by quartering
them, retaining the transparent pulp and juice. Do
not break the skins of the sections. Boil a pound of
loaf sugar in half a glass of water until the syrup
strings when lifted on a fork, then take it from the fire
and dip each section of orange in this candy while it
is hot; you can do this by placing each one on a little
stick cut for the purpose. As the pieces are dipped,
arrange them in some pretty form on a dish or bowl,
and fill up the hollow with whipped cream, sweetened
and seasoned with a glass of maraschino.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">FRANCATELLI’S LEMON PUDDING</span></p>

<p>The juice and grated rind of six lemons, a pint of
milk or cream, six ounces of sponge cake or macaroons,
eight yolks, and the whites of four eggs
(whipped to a froth), one pound of sugar, and a little
salt. Mix in a basin, and work all these materials
together for at least ten minutes. Put a border of puff
paste around a pie-dish, then pour in the batter; strew
cut-up almonds over it, and bake. Sift powdered sugar
over it, and serve.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">WHIPPED CREAM WITH WINE</span></p>

<p>To the whites of three eggs, beaten to a froth, add a
pint of cream, four tablespoonfuls of sweet wine, and
four spoonfuls of sugar. Put bright jelly, or light-colored
marmalade in spots among the cream, and
serve sponge cake with it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BATTER PUDDING</span></p>

<p>One quart of milk, six eggs beaten separately, and
seven tablespoonfuls of flour. Boil the milk, stir in the
eggs and flour, while the milk is nearly hot enough to
boil; do not let it boil when you stir in the flour, but
take it off the fire, or you will curdle the eggs. Bake
this batter half an hour, and eat it with wine or lemon
sauce. You should salt the milk slightly before boiling.
When well and quickly made, this is a delightful pudding,
but it should be eaten hot.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">A SUPERIOR LEMON TART</span></p>

<p>Squeeze the juice from six lemons, wash the rinds
and boil them; if too strong of the lemon oil, it is better
to change the water. You must grate or pound the
rinds, and when tender and cold, add to them one pound
of sugar, one-fourth of a pound of butter, and the yolks
and whites of five eggs. Stir in the juice of the lemons,
and cook the batter gently until it is thick as honey;
then bake it in puff paste without tops. Ornament with
fancy strips of paste.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>

one cup of raisins chopped, a teaspoonful of
powdered cloves and cinnamon, one-half cup of sugar,
two eggs well beaten, half a cup of sweet milk, a little
salt, and two teaspoonfuls of yeastpowder. Stir in

<p>Make a light paste, roll out lengthwise, spread any
kind of fruit over the paste, and roll it up in the dough;
wrap it up in a cloth, tie it carefully, and boil it one
hour. You will find this delicious if made of either
blackberries, strawberries, peaches, or any kind of
dried fruit stewed and sugared; if fresh fruit is used,
it needs no stewing.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">A DESSERT FOR A DELICATE PERSON</span></p>

<p>Boil one cup of rice until perfectly soft, then add a

cake, or macaroons, alternately with currants, or seedless
raisins, chopped citron, or other dried fruit; then
make a boiled custard of six yolks of eggs (for a
moderate size mould), a pint of milk or cream, six
ounces of sugar, a glass of brandy, and the grated rind
of a lemon. Moisten the macaroons with extract of
lemon, and then pour over the custard, which need not
be previously boiled, as the pudding is to be <em>steamed</em>,
and boiling the custard is unnecessary, except when it

add a cup of sugar, and the yolks of the four eggs;
also a lump of butter (the size of an egg). Beat all
well together, thin it by adding the rest of the milk,
flavor it with peach or nutmeg, and set it in the oven
to bake. You must only bake it long enough to cook
the eggs, for, if you leave it to stew and simmer in the
stove, it loses its jelly-like consistence, and the milk
turns to whey. When slightly brown on top, take the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>

spread over it a layer of acid preserve or jelly, such
as plums, apples, grapes, or currants. Then finish it
by making an icing or meringue of the whites of the
eggs, beaten up with a full cup of white sugar; flavor
this with lemon extract, and then put the pudding
again in the stove, and brown. If for a small family,
use a pint of milk and half of all the materials mentioned.

orange, peach or vanilla. Let it stand to get cool, and
pour it into the freezer and surround it with layers of
ice, pounded fine, and coarse dairy salt, well beaten
down, and fill up till within a few inches of the top of
the freezer. Now, if you have it you may pour in one
quart of pure cream, and beat it with a wooden spoon
into the mixture in the freezer. Turn the crank of your
freezer briskly if you have a five minute freezer; if
not, turn the can with your hand for fifteen minutes,
and then pack round again with ice and salt. Draw
off the melted ice and salt water, and fill up again and

half a pound of sugar, and the beaten whites of five
eggs. Mix carefully, place it over a gentle fire, or it
will curdle, stir it in one direction until it looks thick;
strain it through a gauze sieve, and add to it, when
cold, the yolks of five eggs, and a cup of cream or sweet
milk. Set it on the fire until hot enough to cook the
eggs, or nearly ready to boil them, take it off, stir until
cold, and set it on ice, or freeze it as you choose. This
is a delicious cream, with or without freezing, and one
much used by families in Louisiana.</p>

<p>Peel and stone a quart of nice yellow peaches; put
them in a bowl, sweeten them well, and chop very fine.
If you have sweet cream, put to the fruit a quart of it;
if you have not, take a quart of milk, sweeten it with
half a pound of sugar, let it boil, and when boiling,
pour it on to the beaten yolks of four eggs. When this
custard cools, you may add the chopped peaches, which
should be well sweetened. Pour all in the freezer and

<p>Wash the sage or barley clean; take a cup of either;
put it on the fire with water to cover it; boil it gently
until it is soft. While boiling, put in a stick of cinnamon,
or any seasoning that is agreeable. When the
barley has boiled soft and thick, take it off and strain
it; then add to it a rich boiled custard, sweeten it to

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ANOTHER ICE CREAM WITHOUT CREAM</span></p>

<p>When cream can not be procured, a custard made as
directed, is a good substitute. To a quart of milk, add
sugar until it is <em>very sweet</em>, for in freezing it loses
some of its sweetness; let this boil on the fire, when it
boils gently, take it off and pour it scalding hot to the
beaten yolks of eight eggs; stir it constantly, but never
boil it as the scalding milk will cook the eggs sufficiently;
it should also be stirred while cooking. Flavor
with vanilla, or lemon or almond. If with a vanilla
bean it is better to boil it in the milk before putting in
the sugar. When the custard is cold, put it in the form
or freezer. If you have no freezer you can make one,
by using a tin kettle with a tight cover. Set this in the
centre of a tub that is large enough to leave a space of
four or five inches around it; fill the space with layers
of cracked ice and coarse salt, a layer of ice last, and
cover the whole with a woolen cover for half an hour.
Then shake the kettle constantly, after that, until frozen.
Cover up till wanted.</p>

the boiling milk for two minutes and dip them out with
a skimmer as soon as they are cooked. Beat the four
yolks of the eggs with half a cup of corn starch wet
with a little cold milk; set it aside until you can put into
the hot milk a cup of hot strong coffee; then pour in the
mixed corn starch and eggs, give it a little boil and take
it off. Last of all, place the pure white boiled eggs on
the rich brown custard, and you have a beautiful and
appetizing dessert. Serve with sponge cake. Some
boil the coarsely ground coffee in the milk first and
then strain it, proceeding after that as in other custards.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LEMON CHEESE-CAKES</span></p>

<p>Boil the peel of two lemons until tender, and pound

the yolks of six eggs. I make these confections to use
up the yolks when I have been using the whites of eggs
for icing or white cake. Beat the mixture well and add
the juice of the oranges; if the oranges are large the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">WINE JELLY FROM SPARKLING GELATINE</span></p>

<p>Take a package of an ounce, or an ounce and a half
of gelatine, pour upon it a pint of cold water, and let it
remain to soften for an hour or so. When ready to
make the jelly, pour on to the gelatine three-quarters of
a pint of boiling water, and stir until the gelatine is
dissolved; then add to it one and a half pounds of
white sugar, the juice and grated rind of one lemon,
and a spoonful of any essence. Then beat the whites of
two eggs well, and stir briskly into the mixture; put it
on a gentle fire, let it simmer slowly, take it off as soon
as it boils up, then add a pint of wine and two tablespoonfuls
of extract of lemon or vanilla; then strain it
through a jelly bag until it runs clear. Some boil the
extract and wine in the gelatine before straining, but it
injures the fine flavor to do so. Boil the gelatine, the
water, the sugar and eggs, and strain it; after it is
clear and still warm, pour in a pint of wine and set the
jelly on ice in summer, or to cool in the winter. This
should give great satisfaction.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">YELLOW CUSTARD JELLY FROM GELATINE</span></p>

<p>To one ounce of gelatine, soaked in one pint of water,
add a quart of milk; if the weather is warm take a little
less milk. Set the milk and gelatine (or double the
quantity of isinglass) on to get hot, let it give one boil
up, then sweeten it, and when a little cooled stir in the
beaten yolks of eight eggs; do not let the eggs boil up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
or you might curdle them. Flavor with vanilla or
lemon, pour into moulds, and set in a cool place, or on
ice to harden.</p>

<p>Take two calves’ feet, add to them a gallon of water
which you must reduce by boiling to a quart; strain it
while hot, and set away to get cold. When cold take
off the fat, and remove any settlings which may be in
the bottom. Melt the jelly in a stew-pan, and add to it
the whites of six eggs, well beaten, half a pint of wine,
half a pound of white sugar, the juice of four lemons,
and rind of one grated. Boil this a few minutes, and
pass it through a flannel strainer. This is a most delicate
and nourishing article of diet for the sick and convalescent.
If the jelly is dropped upon the sliced peel
of a lemon instead of the grated peel, it will look prettier.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CALVES’ FEET JELLY MADE WITH GELATINE</span></p>

<p>Take three quarts of water, one pint of white wine,
six teaspoonfuls of brandy, six lemons, juice and peel,

yolks not used—three pounds of white sugar, and
four ounces of gelatine. First, soak the gelatine in one
quart of the measured water; let it remain for one-half
an hour. Mix the ingredients named with the other two
quarts, and let all boil twenty minutes; strain it
through a flannel bag without squeezing. Wet the jelly
mould in cold water. Pour the jelly in, and leave it to

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING AND BAKING PIES, TARTS, ETC.</span></p>

<p>The delicacy of pastry depends as much upon the
baking as the making, therefore strict attention should
be paid to the following directions:</p>

<p>Puff paste requires a quick, even heat; a hot oven
will curl the paste and scorch it.</p>

<p>Tart paste or short paste requires a degree less of
heat.</p>

<p>For raised or light crust, the oven may be heated as
for puff paste.</p>

<p>When baking with coal, if the fire is not brisk enough
do not put on more coal, but add a stick or two of hard
wood; or if nearly done, put in a stick of pine wood.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">FAMILY PIE CRUST, SHORT</span></p>

<p>Put a pound of sifted flour into a bowl, work into it
half a pound of sweet lard or beef drippings, with a
dessertspoonful of salt. When it is thoroughly mixed
put to it enough cold water to bind together. Flour the
paste slab, or table, and rolling pin. Take a part of the
paste and roll it to less than a quarter of an inch in
thickness. This will be quite rich enough for health or
taste. A bit of volatile salts, the size of a small nutmeg,
dissolved in a little hot water and put to the
paste, will make it more light and delicate.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">FINEST PUFF PASTE, FOR PUFFS</span></p>

<p>Heap one pound of flour in the centre of the breadboard,
or slab; make a hollow in the centre; break one
egg into it, then add a teaspoonful of salt and a piece
of butter the size of an egg. Mix these lightly together
with a little cold water, adding the water a little at a
time, until the flour is made a nice paste; work it
together, and roll it out to half an inch in thickness.
Then divide a pound of butter in six parts, spread one
part over the paste, then fold it and roll it out again,
until you can perceive the butter through; then spread
over another part, fold it up, and roll out again, and
so continue until all the butter is used, and the paste
has been worked over six times. It is now ready for
making into pies, puffs or any other purpose. Flour the
slab and rolling-pin, and roll it out to a quarter of an
inch in thickness. A marble slab and rolling-pin are
best for pastry, and much more durable than wood. After
using them, scrape them clean, wash them first with
cold water, then pour scalding water over them, and
wipe them dry. Have a sieve ready to sift any flour you
may wish to use; this is but little trouble or delay and
it is always best to sift flour. To gild pastry, wet it
over when nearly done, with the yolk of an egg beaten
with a little milk.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PIE-CRUST</span></p>

<p>Three and a half cups of flour, one cup of sweet lard,
one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of baking powder,
and a cupful of very cold water. Mix with a knife,
using the hands as little as possible. Roll and cut after
the crust is on the pie-plate.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">BUTTERMILK PIE-CRUST—VERY WHOLESOME</span></p>

<p>Take a pint of buttermilk, add one large teacupful of
lard, one teaspoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful of
soda, and flour enough to form a soft dough. Mix the
lard and flour by rubbing them together; then add the
other ingredients. This is a tender and good pie-crust.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BOIL DUMPLING CRUST WITHOUT LARD OR BUTTER—FOR
DYSPEPTICS</span></p>

<p>Sift a pint of flour in a basin, salt it as usual, then
pour on it a fine stream of boiling water from the spout
of a kettle, pour it slowly, or you will overflow the flour;
mix the flour and hot water with a spoon until it is a
nice soft dough that you can handle; then pour it on
the biscuit board, which should be well floured; give it
two or three turns, and it is ready for the fruit. This
is fine for dyspeptics, and altogether lighter and nicer
than the old way of mixing with grease.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO MAKE MINCE PIE MIXTURE</span></p>

<p>Weigh two pounds of the chopped meat; put to it
two pounds of suet free from strings or skin, and chopped
fine; add two pounds of currants, picked, washed,
and dried; four pounds of peeled and chopped rich tart
apples, with the juice of two lemons, and the chopped
peel of one; a pint of sweet wine, and one large nutmeg
grated, or teaspoonful of ground mace; three pounds
and a half of sugar, quarter of an ounce of ground
cloves, or allspice, and the same of cinnamon, and a
large tablespoonful of salt. Mix the whole well together,
put it in a stone pot, or jar, cover it close, and set it
in a cool place for use. Mix it well together again before
using.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">TO FINISH THE PIE MIXTURE</span></p>

<p>Pare, core, and chop, not very fine, some tart juicy
apples; put to them one-third as much of the prepared
meat; stone one pound of raisins, and cut a quarter of
a citron in small bits; add a gill of brandy, and enough
sweet cider to make the whole quite wet. A peck of
apples, pared and chopped, with a quart bowl of the
prepared meat, and the raisins, citron, and cider, as
above-mentioned, with a large teacupful of brown sugar,
is enough to make six or seven pies the size of a
dinner plate. A teacupful of fine chopped suet may be
added if liked, or a tablespoonful of butter to each pie,
as it is to be baked.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MINCE PIE MEAT</span></p>

<p>Take a nice tender piece of beef which is free from
gristle, skin or strings. The meat is used for mincemeat,
also the sirloin, the heart, head and skirts; the
tongue and sirloin are best. Put the meat in hot water,
enough to cover it; boil it gently until turning a fork
in it will break it; set it to become cold, then take out
all the bone and gristle parts. If the tongue is used peel
off the skin, chop it very fine. To this meat, apples,
raisins and spices are added, for which see recipe
mince pie mixture.</p>

with the end of the knife on each side of the
middle, take it carefully up and cover the pie with it,
press it lightly with the finger against the bottom crust,
put it in a quick oven for three-quarters of an hour.
The top may be brushed over with the yolk of an egg

chopped and stoned raisins, the juice of four oranges
and two lemons, with the peel of one lemon chopped,
and a wine-glass of brandy. Mix all carefully and put

one teaspoonful of cloves, and ground cinnamon.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ORANGE PIE</span></p>

<p>To the juice and sliced pulp of two large oranges,
add the grated yellow rind of one orange. Beat the
yolks of three eggs, with a cupful of sugar, and beat
the whites to a high froth and add to them a cup of

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LEMON PIE</span></p>

<p>Grate the rind and express the juice of three lemons;
rub together a cup and a half of powdered sugar and
three tablespoonfuls of butter; beat up the yolks of
four eggs, and add to the butter and sugar, lastly the
lemon; bake on a rich puff paste without an upper
crust. While the pie is baking beat up the whites of the
four eggs with powdered loaf sugar, spread it over the
top of the pie when done; then set back in the oven a
few moments to brown lightly.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">LEMON PIE, WITHOUT CORN STARCH</span></p>

<p>The juice and grated rind of a lemon, one cup of sugar,
two tablespoonfuls water, yolks of three eggs.
Bake in a nice crust. Make an icing of the whites and
a cup of sugar, pour it over the pie, put it back in the

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CRANBERRY PIE OR TARTS</span></p>

<p>Pick a quart of cranberries free from imperfections,
put a pint of water to them, and put them in a stew-pan
over a moderate fire; add a pound of clean brown sugar,
and stew them gently until they are soft; then
mash them with a silver spoon and turn them into a
dish to become cold, then make them in pies or tarts.
Many persons put flour in cranberry pies; it is a great
mistake, as it completely spoils the color of the fruit;
but if they are strained and are too thin to jelly, it is
well to add a spoonful of corn starch to thicken.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CRANBERRY TARTS WITH APPLES</span></p>

<p>Mix half a pint of cranberries with half a pound of
sugar and a spoonful of water; let them simmer a little

rim of paste around a pie plate, strew in the apples,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
pour the cranberries over the apples and cover with a
nice crust. Bake for an hour to cook the apples.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PORK AND APPLE PIE</span></p>

<p>Make the crust in the usual manner (for many ways,
see directions in this book), spread it over a deep
plate; cut nice fat salt pork very thin, and slice some
apples; place a layer of apples, then a layer of pork;
sprinkle with allspice, pepper, and sugar, between each
layer; have three or four layers, and let the last one be
apples; sprinkle in sugar and spice; cover with a top
crust, and bake an hour. This is a plain and wholesome
dish; when the family is large and apples plentiful, it
will be an economical way of giving the boys “apple
pie.”</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MOLASSES PIE</span></p>

<p>Take one pint of molasses, beat into it three eggs

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">HUCKLE OR WHORTLEBERRY PIE</span></p>

<p>Put a quart of picked huckleberries into a basin of
water, take off whatever floats; take up the berries by

<p>Take half a package of gelatine, using a little more

for making jelly; in all other respects use the same
proportions. When ready to strain put it into a large
oval dish (a meat dish is nice); fill it nearly to the
edge; then set it away to harden. Take some egg-shells
that you have broken just the end off in getting
out the egg; make a blanc-mange of corn starch; flavor
it with vanilla, and sweeten; put this into the shells
before it cools and hardens at all; set the eggs on
end in a vegetable-dish so that they will stand top up,
being careful not to let the blanc-mange run out. Cut
some very thin yellow parings off the lemon rind, stew
them in a little sugar and water; when cold lay each
piece separately in a circle on the jelly, making two or
three nests. Break open the egg-shells, take out the
blanc-mange, and lay it in groups like eggs inside the
nest. This makes a very pretty dish, and is very good.
Ivy sprays or myrtle wound around the edge of the

add a tablespoonful of butter, three or four eggs
beaten light, a quart of sweet milk, sugar enough to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
make it quite sweet, and one cup of picked and seeded
raisins. Flavor with nutmeg and essence of lemon or
vanilla. Bake lightly. Do not allow it to remain in
the oven long, as the milk will become watery and thus
destroy the jelly-like consistency of the custard. It is
a nice and cheap dessert for children. The raisins may
be omitted if they are objectionable.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">APPLE POT PIE</span></p>

<p>First, the pastry: Rub into a pint of flour a heaping
spoonful of lard. Strew in a little salt, and work it
until the mass becomes numberless little globules and
balls. Then moisten with cold water, and press them
together until they adhere, and your pastry is made.
It must not be kneaded or worked over at all. Let any
cook try this method, and he will find it the best and
easiest way to make fine leaf paste, and he will never
again countenance the old rolling, larding, butter-spreading
system.</p>

<p>Now for the fruit: Pare, core and quarter one dozen
apples. Put them in a baking pan, with one large cup
of sugar, one tablespoonful of spices, two of molasses
and one of butter; add water until the fruit is nearly
covered, and put it in the oven to bake and stew, and
brown. When the apples begin to soften, dredge in a
little flour, for the juice, though plentiful, must not be
watery. Roll out the pastry. Cut the cover to suit the
pan, and make the trimmings into dumplings, which
must be dropped at intervals among the fruit. Fold
the pie cover in half, make several oblique incisions for
openings, lay it on and brown it lightly. Serve on a
dish like peach cobbler. Like that substantial dessert,
it may be eaten with cream.

<hr class="medium">

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">HINTS ON PRESERVING</span></p>

<p>Preserving kettles should be broad and shallow, with
a handle on each side. If you wish to preserve in
small quantities, use a small kettle. A charcoal furnace
is most desirable in warm weather, as you can put
it where you like, and thus avoid the heat of the
kitchen. Slow, gentle boiling is absolutely necessary in
preserving and pickling.</p>

<p>Crushed or loaf sugar should be used for preserves,
as it is less liable to ferment during the long hot
summer.</p>

<p>Jelly bags may be made of cotton, linen, or flannel,
and can be made like an old-fashioned reticule, with
a string through the top, to close and suspend it while
dripping.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to think dark fruits, like raspberries,
strawberries, etc., can be preserved equally well with
brown sugar, for the color of this sugar makes the
preserves dark, or rather <em>dingy</em>, which is the proper
word.</p>

<p>Glass is best for keeping preserves in, as they may
be examined without opening the jars. When first put
up they should be corked tightly, and dipped into
coarse melted sealing-wax.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO MAKE PRESERVES</span></p>

<p>Most fruits are much easier preserved than jellied.
Weigh the fruit, and to each pound of fruit the usual
rule is a pound of sugar; make a syrup of the sugar

with a half pint of water to each pound of fruit. Boil
it clear, then put in the fruit and cook it well, and boil
gently till the fruit is clear.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO GREEN FRUIT FOR PICKLING OR PRESERVING</span></p>

<p>Put vine leaves under, between, and over the fruit
in a brass kettle, and over the leaves sprinkle a teaspoonful
of beaten or ground alum; cover the fruit to
be greened, with water, and boil it gently with the
leaves and alum; if not a fine green, take more leaves
and dust a little saleratus over them. Spread them out
to cool when green, and proceed to preserve or pickle
them as desired.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO PRESERVE PEACHES</span></p>

<p>Select white clings if you desire to preserve them
whole. Yellow peaches make the most transparent
preserve, but cannot always be procured. If white
clings are convenient, peel and weigh them, and to
each pound of fruit put one pound of sugar and half
a pint of water. Put the syrup to boil, clarify it with
an egg, and as it boils remove the scum. Keep the
peaches in cold water all the time the syrup is boiling,
as water keeps the fruit in good color, while leaving it
exposed darkens it. When the syrup has boiled clear,
put in the peaches; let them boil gently for half an
hour, then take them out on a dish for two hours; put
them back in the syrup and boil again until they are
clear; they are then done, and you can put them in
jars and pour the syrup over them, and cork and seal
up for future use.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">ANOTHER WAY TO PRESERVE PEACHES</span></p>

<p>Peel, cut and weigh six pounds of peaches; take six
pounds of fine white sugar, throw the sugar on the
peaches until they are well covered, and let them stay
all night. Early in the morning add three pints of
water, and boil all together for one hour. Skim carefully,
and then take the peaches out on a large dish,
still keeping the syrup gently boiling, and skimming it
as it boils. Lay the peaches in the sun on dishes for
at least two hours, to harden. Taking the fruit out of
the syrup a few times improves it, giving it firmness
and transparency. Now replace the peaches in the
syrup, and boil gently until they are clear. Cut
peaches are much more easily kept than peaches preserved
whole, but they are not so highly flavored. Cut
fruit does not require so much boiling as whole fruit;
this should be remembered in preserving.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PRESERVED CITRON</span></p>

<p>Pare off the green skin and all the soft part of the
rind, then cut the firm part in strips, or any shape you
fancy. Allow a pound and a quarter of sugar to each
pound of rind; line your porcelain kettle with grapevine
leaves and fill with the rind, scattering a little
pulverized alum over each layer. Cover with vine-leaves
three thick, pour on water enough to reach and
wet these and cover with a close lid. Let them heat
together for three hours, but the water must not actually
boil. Take out the rind, which will be well
greened by this process, and throw at once into very
cold water. Let it soak for four hours, changing the
water for fresh every hour. Then make a syrup, allowing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
two cups of water to every pound and a quarter
of syrup. Boil and skim until no more scum comes
up; put in the rind and simmer gently nearly an hour.
Take it out and spread on dishes in the sun until firm
and almost cool. Simmer in the syrup for half an
hour; spread out again, and when firm put into a large
bowl and pour over it the scalding syrup. Next day
put the syrup again over the fire, add the juice of a
lemon and a tiny bit of ginger-root for every pound of
rind. Boil down until thick, pack the rind in jars and
pour over it the syrup. Tie up when cool.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO PRESERVE PEARS</span></p>

<p>Take small rich pears, and boil them gently in water
until they will yield to the pressure of the finger. They
must not be soft, or they will not preserve well. Take
them out when a little boiled; let them cool, and pare
them neatly, leaving a little of the stem on, as well as
the blossom end. Make a syrup of a pound of sugar
to a pound of fruit, and when it is boiling hot, pour
it on the pears; next day boil them in the syrup till
clear, and bottle them for use.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PINEAPPLE PRESERVES</span></p>

<p>Take fine pineapples, cut off all the rough parts, and
each apple in quarters, shaping each piece alike. Boil
the pineapples in just enough water to cover them, and
put to this water all the cuttings, so as to make the
syrup as rich in flavor as possible. When the pieces
are tender, take them out, weigh them, and make a
syrup of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit,
allowing a cup of the water the pineapples were boiled
in, to each pound of fruit. Strain the water over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
sugar, mix it, and let it boil fifteen minutes, by itself;
skim it, and put in the pineapples, letting them boil
until they are clear and perfectly tender. Pears done
in this way make a delicious preserve. The usual way
of putting them in the syrup without previous boiling,
makes them little better than sweetened leather, as it
makes them tough and stringy.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO PRESERVE CRAB APPLES, GREEN</span></p>

<p>Wash the apples and boil them in a very little water,
cover them with vine leaves, while on the fire simmering,
and they will then be very yellow. Take them out
and spread them on a large dish to cool. Pare and
core them, put them back in the kettle, with fresh leaves
to cover them. Hang them over the fire, or on the
stove in a preserving kettle until they are green; then
take them out of the pot, let them cool, weigh them,
and allow a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Put
only water sufficient to dissolve the sugar, as the fruit,
having been already boiled, will require very little
water—a small cupful to each pound being quite
enough. Boil this syrup, skim it, and put in your green
apples, and boil them until they are clear and tender.
Put the apples in jars, turn the juice on to them, and
when cold tie them up, or rather seal them in this
Southern climate.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PEACH OR APPLE COMPOTE, FOR DESSERT</span></p>

<p>Dissolve and boil a pound of loaf sugar in a pint of
water; skim it, pare six or eight apples, or a dozen
peaches, throw them into the boiling syrup, and cook
until tender and transparent. Lemon improves the
apples, but peaches are better without it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">PRESERVED HUCKLEBERRIES</span></p>

<p>Take them just as they begin to ripen, pick and weigh
them, allow a pound of fruit to a pound of sugar, then
stew them until quite clear, and the syrup becomes
thick. These make nice tarts when fruit is scarce.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PLUM PRESERVES</span></p>

<p>Get plums before they are dead ripe; allow a pound
of sugar to a pound of fruit, dissolve and boil the sugar
and water (allowing half a pint of water to a pound).
Boil the syrup until it is thick, then put in the plums
and boil them until they are transparent; then put
them in sealed jars.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">FIG PRESERVES</span></p>

<p>Boil the sugar and water syrup as directed in previous
recipe. Let the figs be firm, not dead ripe or
they will boil to a mass. They should be laid in alum
the day before they are to be preserved, then taken out,
washed, and put into the boiling syrup. Boil for three
hours, or until transparent; then bottle as usual and
seal up with wax.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MYRTLE ORANGE PRESERVE, OR HOME-MADE LIMES</span></p>

<p>Pluck the oranges before they turn yellow; they
should be a rich dark green; cut a hole in the stem end
and take out all the white pulp and seeds; scrape them
carefully, grate the rind so as to break the oil cells,
and allow the strong oil to escape. Wash them and
throw them into strong salt and water; let them stay
in it for three days, then soak them in fresh water
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
three days. When you wish to preserve them you must
boil them in clear water, slowly, in a brass kettle;
cover them with a few orange leaves while boiling,
which will green them, and boil until they are tender,
then set them up to cool. Weigh as much sugar as you
have oranges, and allow pound for pound; boil the
syrup clear and then put in the oranges; boil gently
for half an hour, or until green and yellow. Use only
a silver spoon in making this preserve.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO MAKE WATERMELON PRESERVES</span></p>

<p>Take the firm outside rind of the watermelon; scrape
off the green and cut out the soft inside; cut the rind
into any shapes you choose, stars, crescents, diamonds,
etc. After they have been boiled in alum and leaves
to green and harden, weigh them and make a syrup of
a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit, with a cup of
water to each pound. Boil the syrup clear, and put in
the cut rinds, and boil them until transparent. Flavor
with ginger for green color, and lemons for the yellow.
If the rind is wanted yellow you must boil it with fresh
lemon skins and a little saffron before preserving it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ANOTHER WATERMELON RIND PRESERVE</span></p>

<p>In a bucket of cold water, put a handful of lime, stir
it in, and when it settles clear, pour it over the watermelon
rind you intend preserving; let it stay in the
weak lime-water one day. Soak it a few hours, and
get the taste of the lime from the rind, then put it in
alum water and scald for ten minutes. Put grape-leaves
in with the alum water while scalding; they will
make the rind green. Take the rind from the alum,
and put it in cold water for a few hours, and when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
cold, boil it in strong ginger tea until it is soft, and
tastes of the ginger. Make the syrup of one and a half
pounds of sugar to each pound of rind, and a half pint
of water to each pound of sugar. Let it cook slowly,
skim it, and when it looks clear, put in the rind, and
let it cook slowly until clear and transparent. The
rind should be cut into beautiful shapes, and preserved
with care. This is a little trouble; but the housekeeper
is amply repaid by the beauty of the preserve.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO MAKE ANY KIND OF FRUIT JELLY</span></p>

<p>Wash and drain the fruit, put it in a stone jar, and
put the jar into a kettle of water over the fire; let it
boil, but see that none of the water gets into the fruit.
When the fruit is tender, it will begin to break; pour
it now into a flannel bag, but do not squeeze it—that
will make the jelly cloudy. To each pint of juice
strained, add one pound, or one pound and a quarter
of white sugar, and the half of the beaten white of an
egg. Boil this rapidly, skim, but do not stir the syrup,
as stirring breaks its continuity and prevents its jellying.
Boil it twenty minutes, and try a little in some
cold water, to find out if it jellies; if it does not, boil
it a little longer. Too much boiling, or too slow boiling,
injures jelly and makes it ropy. Too much sugar will
cause jelly to grain; the quantity used must be in accordance
with the requirements of the fruit, acid fruit
requiring more sugar and dead ripe fruit less. Red
currants take more sugar than black currants; they
also take more time to boil to a jelly. A little practice
<em>and a few mistakes</em> will make anyone who takes pleasure
in cooking a good jelly-maker and preserver.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">CRAB APPLE JELLY</span></p>

<p>This is the best of all apple jellies. Wash the apples,
cut them up, remove all defects, remove the seeds and
the blossom end; but do not pare them. Lay them in
your preserving-kettle, and cover them with water;
then boil them until they are soft, but do not let them
mash up from too much boiling. Drain off all the
water, and mash the apples with the back of a silver
spoon. Put this in a jelly bag, and place a deep dish
under it to collect the juice. To every pint of the juice
allow a pint of loaf sugar; boil it and skim it. It will
be ready to dip out into tumblers in half an hour, if
you have complied with these directions. Always dip
jelly out with a <em>silver</em> spoon, as any other kind darkens
fruit. I have seen preserves rendered very dark by
putting in them a new-tinned dipper. You must be
careful of these things if you desire your confections
to be elegant.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LEMON JELLY. A BEAUTIFUL DISH</span></p>

<p>Set an ounce of isinglass in a pint of water on the
stove in a stew-pan; stir the isinglass until it dissolves.
Let it boil a few minutes, then add a pint of lemon
juice sweetened with a pound and a half of sugar, or a
little more, if it is wished very sweet. Stir this in with
the rinds of six lemons, and boil all together. After
boiling for about five minutes, put a teaspoonful of
saffron in to color it yellow, and strain through a
flannel bag. Fill your jelly-glasses with it; when cool,
it is a most beautiful dish for a collation.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">BLACKBERRY JELLY</span></p>

<p>Cook the fruit till tender in a little water; throw off
the water, bruise and strain the fruit, and to each pint
of the juice add one pound of white sugar. Put it now
in a preserving-pan, and boil it <em>rapidly</em>, but do not stir
it while boiling, as that breaks the jelly; skim it carefully,
and when it jellies, pour it into tumblers or small
jars. I have made two pecks of berries into jelly in
two hours. This is said for the benefit of young housekeepers
who often boil their jelly too slowly and too
long, which makes it ropy.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">APPLE JELLY, WITHOUT WATER</span></p>

<p>Pare and core the fruit, which should be juicy and
tart. Lay the apples in a vessel to cook without putting
in any water; cover them closely, and cook until
properly soft; strain the juice, and add three-fourths
of a pound of sugar to a pint of apple juice. Beat in
the white of an egg to clarify the jelly, and skim it as
it boils; try it and, as soon as it jellies, take it from
the fire and put it in glasses.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">JAM</span></p>

<p>This can be made from almost any kind of ripe fruit.
Blackberries, strawberries or raspberries are especially
suited for this form of preserve. You must
weigh your fruit (say blackberries), and allow three
quarters of a pound of good sugar to each pound of
fruit. Crush the fruit and sugar, with a biscuit beater,
until they are well mashed; add a gill of water to each
pound of fruit; boil gently (not rapidly like jelly) until
it becomes a jelly-like mass, and when done, put it into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
glasses, or small earthenware pots and when cold,
cover up like jelly. This is an excellent medicine in
summer for dysentery; but if intended for invalids,
you must spice it, and add a gill of brandy—fourth
proof—to each pound of jam.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TOMATO JAM</span></p>

<p>Take nice ripe tomatoes, skin them, take out all their
seeds, but save the juice to put with the sugar. Weigh
the fruit, and to each pound, add three-fourths of a
pound of sugar; boil some lemons soft, take one for
each pound of tomatoes, mash them fine, take out the
pips, and put the lemons to the sugar and tomatoes;
boil slowly and mash the jam smooth with a silver
spoon. When smooth and jelly-like, it is done. Put it
away in glasses carefully.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ORANGE MARMALADE. DELICIOUS</span></p>

<p>Quarter the oranges and take out the seeds and
white strings. To every pound of pulp, add a cup of
cold water, and let it stand thus for twenty-four hours.
Boil some of the peel in several waters until quite tender;
then to each pound of pulp, add one-quarter of a
pound of boiled peel, and one and a quarter pounds of
white sugar. Boil this slowly until it jellies, and the
bits of peel are quite transparent.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ORANGE MARMALADE MADE WITH HONEY</span></p>

<p>Quarter a dozen large ripe oranges; remove the
rind, seeds and filaments, but save all the juice. Put
the juice and pulp into a porcelain kettle, with an equal
quantity of strained honey, adding one-third as much
sugar as honey. Boil until very thick, sweet and clear.
When cold, put it in small jars.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">MARMALADE</span></p>

<p>This jam can be made of any ripe fruit, boiled to a
pulp with a little water; the best are peaches, quinces,
apples, oranges and cranberries. It is usual to crush
the fruit. Put in three quarters of a pound of sugar
to a pound of fruit, add a <em>little</em> water (half a cup to a
pound), and boil until it is a jellied mass. When done,
put it in glass or white earthenware.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO CANDY FRUIT</span></p>

<p>After peaches, quinces, plums, or citron, have been
preserved, take them from the syrup, and drain them
on a sieve. To a pound of loaf sugar, put a small cup
of water, and when it is dissolved, set it over a moderate
fire, and let it boil; when it boils, put in the fruit
to be candied, and stir continually until the sugar
granulates over the fruit; then take it up, and dry it
in a warm oven. If not sufficiently candied, repeat the
operation.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CANDIED PUMPKIN</span></p>

<p>Peel a piece of pumpkin, and cut it in thin slices.
Make a nice, thick syrup of brown sugar and water,
and put the pumpkin into it, with a little of the juice
of the lemon. Boil this until the pumpkin is nicely
candied. Mace, or other spices, may be used for flavoring
instead of lemon, if preferred. It may be eaten
hot with meats at dinner, and is equally nice, when
cold, for supper or lunch.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">ORGEAT SYRUP WITHOUT ORANGE FLOWERS</span></p>

<p>Make a syrup of a pound of sugar to every pint of
water; boil this a few minutes, skim it clear, and when
cold, to every four pounds of sugar used, allow a gill of
orange water, or rose water, and two tablespoonfuls of
pure essence of bitter almonds. Serve it in iced water.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ORANGE SYRUP</span></p>

<p>This syrup is so easily made, and oranges are so
abundant here, that it is advantageous to make this
syrup in the season of orange harvest, in Louisiana.
To make it, you must select ripe and thin-skinned
fruit; squeeze the juice, and to every pint, add a pound
and a quarter of white sugar; boil it slowly, and skim
as long as any scum rises; you may then take it off,
let it grow cold, and bottle it. Be sure to secure the
corks well. This is nice for a summer drink for delicate
persons; it is also very convenient for pudding
sauces, as half a cup of this syrup, mixed with melted
butter, is admirable, where wine is not used. The
flavor is so fine, it requires very little spicing to make
it agreeable.

<p>Soak fine peaches in lye until you can remove the
fuzzy outside; wipe them, and turn them into cold
water. When you have prepared as many as you desire,
weigh them, and to every pound of fruit, put
three quarters of a pound of white sugar. Make a
syrup like that for preserves, only using less water;
boil the peaches in the syrup until they are tender;
then take them out of the kettle, and place them in
jars; fill up the jars with a brandy syrup, made of a
pint of brandy, to a pint of the sugar syrup from the
peaches. Cook them very carefully, and dip the mouths
of the jars in rosin melted, and keep them in a cool
dark place.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">APRICOTS IN BRANDY</span></p>

<p>Peaches and apricots are brandied the same way.
Gather them as fresh as possible. Apricots should be
taken from the tree as soon as ripe, as they soften so
rapidly. Rub each one with a coarse towel, but do not
peel it. Make a syrup of half the weight of the fruit
in sugar, and just water enough to dissolve it. When
the syrup is prepared and hot, put in the apricots, let
them simmer until tender; then take the fruit out, and
place it on dishes, then expose them to the sun, or in a
warm oven to dry and harden. Boil the syrup again,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
after the fruit is out, until it is quite rich and thick.
Skim it carefully. When the apricots are cold and
firm, put them in white earthen preserve-jars and fill
up with syrup and brandy, half and half. Tie up with
bladder skin.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PEACHES AND APRICOTS IN BRANDY</span></p>

<p>Take nice smooth peaches not too ripe, put them in
a vessel and cover them with weak lye; take them out
in two hours, and wipe carefully to get off the down
and outside skin, and lay them in cold water. Weigh
the fruit, add their weight in sugar, and half a pint of
water to each pound of sugar; boil and skim this syrup,
put in the peaches; when the syrup is clear of scum,
let them boil for twenty minutes or half an hour, then
take them out and lay them on dishes to cool. Boil the
syrup for an hour longer, or until reduced one-half and
quite thick. When cold, put the peaches or apricots in
jars, and cover them with equal quantities of the syrup
and French brandy. If it is apricots, cook them very
gently, or they will come to pieces in the syrup; ten
minutes is long enough to stew them before bottling.</p>

<p>Mash the apricots or peaches in a mortar, remove
the stones, and to eight pounds of the pulp, add one
quart of water; let this stand twenty-four hours; then
strain, and to each gallon of the juice, add two pounds
of loaf sugar. Let it ferment, and when perfectly
clear, bottle it. Peach wine is very nice, and may have
a few of the kernels added for flavoring, if wished.</p>

<p>Take the outer rind of one hundred oranges pared,
so that no white appears; pour upon them ten gallons

warm. While still warm, add the juice of the oranges,
mixed with twenty-five pounds of lump sugar, and a
few tablespoonfuls of good yeast; let it ferment five
days, or until the fermentation has ceased, and the
wine is clear; then bottle. Lemon wine can be made
in the same way.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SOUR ORANGE WINE</span></p>

<p>Take one gallon juice of sour oranges, four gallons

in a vessel large enough to hold it, and skim it as
it boils until no more scum rises. Pour it into a flannel
bag and strain; then put it in a cask, adding to it a
quart of uncooked orange juice. Let it ferment, and
when clear, bottle it. This will require about six
months to finish. Keep in a cool closet or cellar during
fermentation.</p>

this time. The third day strain off the juice, and
to every gallon of this strained liquor, put two pounds

in a wide-mouthed stone jar to ferment. Cover it carefully
with a cloth, to keep out all insects; open it and
skim it every morning; then cover it up again carefully,
for much of the bouquet of the wine depends on
this. When it ceases to ferment, strain it and put it
in a demijohn; do not cork it tightly, as it must have
a little air, but cover the loose stopper with a piece

get all the juice out you can by squeezing, but do not
let the pulp and seed come through the bag. Now add
a little of the water they were boiled in, however not
more than two tablespoonfuls to each pint of strained
juice. To every pint of this liquor, add one pound of
loaf sugar, one teaspoonful of mace, same of cloves
and cinnamon. Boil all these together a few minutes,
and strain it again to free it from the spice. When
this syrup is cool, add to each pint a wineglass of good
French brandy. If you cannot get brandy, substitute
rum or whiskey, remembering to use twice as much as
you would brandy. This is excellent for children during
the prevalence of summer complaints, and an excellent
tonic for all debilitated persons.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BLACKBERRY CORDIAL</span></p>

<p>Select fine, ripe fruit. Squeeze the berries without
boiling, and to a quart of the strained juice, put a
pound of loaf sugar; boil it for half an hour, and add
a quart of brandy, some cloves and cinnamon, when on
the fire. If the fruit thickens too rapidly while boiling,
throw in a cup of hot water.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">RASPBERRY CORDIAL</span></p>

<p>Squeeze the fruit through a flannel bag, and to every
quart of juice to a pound of loaf sugar; put it in a
stone jar and stir it constantly for half an hour; allow
it to stand for three days, then strain it again and add
to each quart of juice a quart of fine brandy.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">TOMATO WINE</span></p>

<p>Let the tomatoes be very ripe; mash them well, let
them stand twenty-four hours, strain, and to every
quart of the tomato juice, add a pound of white sugar.
This will ferment and should be allowed to do so, only
keep it carefully covered from the flies. Skim off the
foam as it rises, and when the liquor becomes clear,
bottle it. This wine will be a pleasant acid, and should
be served with sugar and water, in the tumbler with
the wine.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ANOTHER TOMATO WINE</span></p>

<p>Bruise your berries, or small tomatoes; measure the
juice, and add two pounds of sugar to each gallon; put
it in a cask, adding two gallons of water to each four
gallons of juice. Let it ferment like blackberry wine.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">A FINE TEMPERANCE BEVERAGE</span></p>

<p>To the juice of a dozen lemons put one pound and a
half of double refined sugar, and a picked quart of
raspberries or strawberries; pare a ripe pineapple and
slice it, put over it half a pound of sugar, stir the lemon
juice with the sugar, crush in the berries slightly
bruise the pineapple and chop it up in small pieces.
Put the lemon juice in a large punch bowl, add to it
three quarts of ice water, then put in the strawberry
and pineapple juice, stir it until all the sugar is dissolved,
and then set it on ice. Serve in punch glasses.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHAMPAGNE PUNCH</span></p>

<p>Add to the above mixture a bottle of champagne, and
a bottle of white wine, and you have a very delicious
punch for festive occasions.

SICK AND CONVALESCENT</h2>
</div>
<hr class="medium">

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BARLEY WATER</span></p>

<p>Take four large tablespoonfuls of picked and washed
pearl barley, and put it into a porcelain-lined kettle
with two quarts of boiling water; let it boil slowly
until the water is reduced one half, then strain it and
season with salt, lemon, or sugar as may be agreeable
to the sick.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TOAST WATER</span></p>

<p>Cut two or three slices from a loaf of wheat bread,
toast them very brown; while hot, put them in a small
pitcher, and pour over them a pint and a half of water.
Sugar may be added if liked, but when the stomach is
affected it is better without it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO MAKE WATER GRUEL OF CORN MEAL OR OAT MEAL</span></p>

<p>Put a quart of water on to boil in a stew-pan. Take
a tablespoonful of sweet corn meal, or oatmeal, make
it into a batter with milk and salt, stir it in the boiling
water and let it boil gently for half an hour. When
served it may be sweetened and nutmeg grated over
it. If wanted for a strengthening nourishment, a bit
of butter and a glass of wine or brandy may be added.
This is generally given after a dose of castor oil, or an
emetic. Use very little salt.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">BEEF TEA FOR INVALIDS</span></p>

<p>Cut tender lean beef into small pieces, free it from
fat and strings, fill a junk bottle with it, cork it tight
and put it in a kettle of boiling water; let it boil three
hours. In that way you obtain the juices of the meat
undiluted. This is especially nourishing and good
when the stomach can bear but little liquid.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MILK PUNCH AS A RESTORATIVE</span></p>

<p>Take a large tumbler (it should hold a pint), half
fill it with chopped ice, add to it a large tablespoonful
of white sugar, beat it a little with the ice, then pour
on it a wineglass of gin, rum or brandy, and fill up
with fresh milk. It is generally very acceptable to an
invalid who refuses other stimulants.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">APPLE TEA, OR WATER, FOR INVALIDS</span></p>

<p>Cut some ripe apples into thin pieces, add the peel
of a fresh lemon; pour boiling water over them and
let it stand till cold, then sweeten with loaf sugar.
This is a grateful and cooling drink.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BAKED APPLES</span></p>

<p>Bake them in a tin roaster, as iron discolors them;
pour molasses over them and bake until soft. This is
good for opening the bowels of patients who are a little
constipated.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ARROW-ROOT BLANC MANGE FOR THE SICK</span></p>

<p>Put a pint of new milk to boil; make a smooth batter
with an ounce of Bermuda arrow-root and cold milk;
add a little salt, and when the milk is boiling stir in the
batter; let the fire be gentle or it will scorch; sweeten
this with fine white sugar, and let it boil a few minutes;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
flavor with lemon, or orange water, or if lemon
is objected to, boil a vanilla bean in the milk before
the arrow-root is put in. Take it off the fire, pour it
in a mould and set it on ice; serve jelly or jam with
the blanc mange, or eat it with cream if it agrees with
the invalid.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ARROW-ROOT BLANC MANGE</span></p>

<p>Mix in a little cold water, two tablespoonfuls of
arrow-root; sweeten a pint of milk with white sugar
and put the arrow-root in the milk. Let it boil a few
minutes, stirring it constantly; take it off, and if desired,
you can let it cool and mould it in a bowl or
jelly form; or it is nice to be eaten warm. Colored
jelly over it is an improvement when moulded.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ARROW-ROOT GRUEL</span></p>

<p>Mix a tablespoonful of arrow-root, or for an infant,
half as much; when mixed with cold water, stir in it
half a pint of boiling water. Season with salt, sugar
or nutmeg.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MILK PORRIDGE</span></p>

<p>Make a quart of milk boiling hot; make a tablespoonful
of flour into a batter with cold milk, add a little
salt and stir it in the boiling milk, stirring it constantly
for five minutes while it boils; flavor with anything
agreeable. Sweetened with loaf sugar, and nutmeg
grated plentifully over it, it will make a most excellent
remedy for looseness or dysentery.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TAPIOCA MILK</span></p>

<p>Wash and soak a large tablespoonful of tapioca, put
it to a quart of sweet milk, add a little salt, cover it, and
set it over a gentle fire for an hour. Take it up, add
sugar and nutmeg, or cinnamon to taste.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">TAPIOCA PUDDING</span></p>

<p>Put a coffee-cup of tapioca (soak it well first) into a
pint and a half of milk, set it where it will get hot
slowly, take it off when it boils, and when cool add four
well-beaten eggs; flavor with lemon and peach, sweeten
it to taste, and bake for an hour in a hot oven. If this
is wanted for one person, take half the quantity of
tapioca and milk.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">WHITE WINE SYLLABUB</span></p>

<p>Season a pint of milk with sugar and wine, but not
enough wine to curdle the milk. Fill your glasses
nearly full, and crown them with sweetened whipped
cream. Season the cream with extract of lemon.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SYLLABUB</span></p>

<p>Take the juice of a large lemon, and the yellow rind
pared thin; one glass of brandy, two glasses of white
wine, and a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.
Put these ingredients into a pan, and let them remain
one night; the next day add a pint of thick cream, and
the whites of two eggs beaten together; beat them all
together to a fine froth, and serve in jelly glasses.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">WINE SANGAREE OF PORT OR MADEIRA</span></p>

<p>Take half a glass of water, sweeten it with a tablespoonful
of white powdered sugar, and stir well until
dissolved; add a gill of Madeira or Port, some nutmeg
grated and pounded ice. Serve with lady-cake or
pound-cake, cut small.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">STEWED PRUNES FOR SICKNESS</span></p>

<p>Wash the prunes, put them in a stew pan, cover them
with water, and to each pound of prunes put a cupful
of clear brown sugar. Cover the stew-pan and let
them boil slowly, until the syrup is thick and rich.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">WINE JELLY FOR THE SICK</span></p>

<p>Take one pint of Madeira wine, one pint of water,
and one ounce of isinglass dissolved in a teacupful of
water. Let the wine and water be boiling hot, then stir
into it the dissolved isinglass, and sugar to taste; make
it quite sweet; let it come to a boil, try it by taking a
little in a saucer, and if not a good jelly when cold, boil
it until it is so; if lemon is allowed, use the juice of two
to flavor this jelly.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">JAUNE MANGE</span></p>

<p>Break up and boil an ounce of isinglass in rather
more than half a pint of water until it is melted; strain
it; then add the juice of two large oranges, a gill of
white wine, and the yolks of four eggs beaten and
strained; sweeten to taste, and stir it over a gentle fire
till it boils up; dip a mould into cold water and pour
the preparation into it.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CARRIGEEN MOSS FOR INVALIDS</span></p>

<p>Wash and pick a tablespoonful of Irish moss and put
it into a tin cup; pour on it half a pint of boiling water,
and set it on the coals for a short time; when it is all
dissolved add sugar and nutmeg to taste. This may
be made with milk, to resemble custard, and is very
nourishing. Delicate infants may be fed on it when
they will take no other nourishment.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">TARTARIC ACID AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LEMONS</span></p>

<p>If lemons cannot be obtained to make either a lemonade
or jellies for the sick, tartaric acid is a good substitute,
and if used in conjunction with the extract of
lemon, is a very agreeable one.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LEMON JELLY WITHOUT LEMONS</span></p>

<p>Take a box of Cox’s gelatine, pour over it one quart
of boiling water, and stir until it is dissolved. Add a
teaspoonful of tartaric acid, and four cups of sugar;
let it dissolve and bring it to a boil; while boiling, stir
in the beaten whites of three eggs; let this boil up once
again and take it off the fire; when nearly cool, add to
it a tablespoonful of good extract of lemon. Strain the
mixture into moulds or cups, and set it in a cool place,
or on ice, to become firm. It must be cool, or it will
not jelly.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ORANGE SHERBET</span></p>

<p>Squeeze the juice from a dozen oranges; pour boiling
water on the peel, and cover it closely. Boil water
and sugar (a pint to a pound) to a syrup; skim it
clear; when all are cold, mix the syrup, juice and peel
with as much water as may be necessary to make a rich
orangeade; strain it, and set the vessel containing it
on ice. Or it may be made the same as lemonade, using
one lemon with half a dozen oranges.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">STRAWBERRY SHERBET</span></p>

<p>Take fifteen ounces of picked strawberries, crush
them in a mortar, then add to them a quart of
water; pour this into a basin, with a sliced lemon, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
a teaspoonful of orange-flower water; let it remain for
two or three hours. Put eighteen ounces of sugar into
another basin, cover it with a cloth, through which
<a id="chg7"></a>pour the strawberry juice; after as much has run
through as will, gather up the cloth, and squeeze out
as much juice as possible from it; when the sugar is
all dissolved, strain it again. Set the vessel containing
it on ice, until ready to serve.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ALMOND CUSTARD</span></p>

<p>Blanch and beat four ounces of almonds fine, with
a spoonful of water; beat a pint of cream with two
spoonfuls of rose water, add them to the yolks of four
eggs and as much sugar as will make it pretty sweet;
stir it over a slow fire till it is of a proper thickness,
but do not boil. Pour it into custard glasses.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SPONGE CAKE PUDDING</span></p>

<p>Stale sponge or other plain cake may be made into
a nice pudding by crumbling it into a little more than
a pint of milk and two or three beaten eggs, and baking
it. Sauce—sugar and butter beaten together.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">GERMAN LADIES’ FINGERS</span></p>

<p>Beat one hour the yolks of five eggs with half a
pound of sugar; add half a pound of blanched almonds
pounded fine, the yellow part of one lemon grated.
Mix well; add half a pound of flour very gradually.
Roll out the paste, and cut it into strips the length and
size of the forefinger; beat lightly the whites of two
eggs, and wet the fingers.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">DIMPLES</span></p>

<p>Beat the whites of three eggs very stiff, add gradually
three quarters of a pound of sugar, and beat till
it is well mixed. Blanch almonds, and cut them into
pieces—as small as peas, and stir them into the egg
and sugar—three quarters of a pound of almonds for
three eggs. Drop the mixture in spots as large as a
half penny on white paper upon a tin, and bake in a
cool oven.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">DELICATE RUSKS FOR CONVALESCENTS</span></p>

<p>Half a pint of new milk, and one cup of hop yeast;
add flour to make a batter, and set the sponge at night.
In the morning add half a pint of milk, one cup of
sugar, one of butter, one egg, one nutmeg, and flour to
make it sufficiently stiff. Let it rise, then roll it, and
cut it out; let it rise again, and then bake.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHOCOLATE CARAMELS</span></p>

<p>Half a pound of chocolate, three pounds of dark
brown sugar, one-eighth pound of butter, a small teacup
of milk; season with vanilla, or grated lemon or
orange-peel. Boil it very quickly over a hot fire, stirring
constantly. When it becomes hard on being
dropped into water, take it off the fire and stir for a
few moments before pouring into buttered dishes. Before
it is quite cool, cut into little squares. Those who
like the caramel very hard need not stir it, as this
makes it “sugary.” The grated peel should not be
put in till the caramel is taken from the fire.

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO MAKE CHOCOLATE</span></p>

<p>Scrape the best chocolate; allow for each square, or
large spoonful of ground chocolate, half a pint of milk
or milk and water; let it boil a few moments, then put
it on the back part of the stove, and it is ready when
wanted.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO MAKE CHOCOLATE ANOTHER WAY</span></p>

<p>Scrape or grate the chocolate, take a heaping tablespoonful
for each cup to be served; allow half a pint of
milk or milk and water to each heaping spoonful of
chocolate. Make the milk hot, rub the chocolate to a
smooth paste with the cold milk, then stir it in the boiling
milk. Let it boil up once; cover it and set it back
in a place where it will keep warm. It is now ready to
serve. Toasted biscuit or rolls should be served with
it. Sweeten the chocolate unless you use the prepared
chocolate.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TEA—GREEN AND BLACK</span></p>

<p>Scald your tea-pot <em>always</em> before putting in the tea;
throw out the scalding water and allow a teaspoonful
of tea to each person expected to drink it; turn on half
a pint of boiling water at first, and let it steep—green
tea requires about five minutes, black tea ten minutes.
After this, pour on more boiling water, according to
the number of persons. Mixed black and green tea is
considered a more healthful drink than green tea alone.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">COFFEE CREAM</span></p>

<p>Take three cups of good clear coffee, sweeten it well
and boil with it a pint of cream until reduced one-third.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">COFFEE</span></p>

<p>Old Java and Mocha are the best coffees. A coffee
roaster is the best thing to roast coffee in, but an iron
pot is very good; coffee should be dried gradually before
being roasted. “Dripped” coffee is the French
mode, but many make it in the old-time way by boiling.
It is a matter of personal taste, not to be interfered
with in this “land of the free.” To make
dripped coffee we grind a cupful for four persons, put
this ground coffee in the top of the dripper and pour
on half a pint of boiling water. It is served with boiling
milk at breakfast.

<hr class="medium">

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CREAM CANDY</span></p>

<p>To make cream candy take two pounds of light
brown sugar, one teacup of water, two tablespoonfuls
of butter, one of vinegar, and two of flavoring extract.
Dissolve the sugar in the water, but do not stir it. Set
it on to boil, let it boil briskly for twenty minutes, then
try it by dropping a spoonful in a glass of cold water.
If cooked enough to pull, butter some dishes and pour
it into them; when cool enough to handle, pull it until
it becomes as white as cream.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">ANOTHER CREAM CANDY</span></p>

<p>Three cups of sugar, half a cup of vinegar, and one-third
of a cup of water. Boil together until it is thick
and will harden when dropped into a cup of water.
Butter some dishes, and just before filling them, add to
the candy some flavoring essence; if you put this in
earlier it will boil out. Pour the candy on the buttered
dishes, and when a little cool prepare to pull it until it
is white and light, which it will be if made by these
directions.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">POP-CORN CANDY</span></p>

<p>Take a cup of molasses, one and a half cups of brown
sugar, a tablespoonful of vinegar and a lump of butter
the size of an egg. Boil until thick. Chop two cups of
popped corn rather fine, put it into the boiling candy,
and pour it all on the buttered plates. Cut in squares
to be eaten without pulling.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">CHOCOLATE PASTE FOR CAKE</span></p>

<p>Boil one-half a cup of chocolate in one-half cup of
milk, add a cup of sugar, and boil, until it is a thick
paste.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LOUISIANA ORANGE FLOWER MACAROONS</span></p>

<p>Take a coffee cup of the freshly gathered petals of
the orange, cut them with a pair of scissors into two
pounds of dry, sifted white sugar; this keeps their
color fresh. Beat the whites of seven eggs to a stiff
froth, and add to the orange flowers and sugar. Drop
this mixture on white paper in small cakes, and bake
in a slow oven; do not let them brown.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MOLASSES CANDY</span></p>

<p>Take two quarts of molasses and one pound of brown
sugar, and the juice of two lemons. Let the molasses
and sugar boil moderately, without stirring it, for two
hours; if not thick enough to pull then, let it boil a
little longer; then put in your extract, for if this is put
in earlier the flavor will boil away. When the candy
is cool enough to handle, put into the pot a pint of
parched pinders, or pecan meats, or almonds cut up.
Butter two large dishes and pour out the candy.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">MOLASSES CANDY OF OUR GRANDFATHERS’ TIME</span></p>

<p>One quart of molasses, and butter the size of an egg.
Stew over a brisk fire till it will harden on being
dropped into cold water. A teaspoonful of essence of
wintergreen should be added when it is almost done.
Pull it while warm, with buttered hands, and cut in
sticks.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">SUGAR CANDY</span></p>

<p>Six cups of sugar, one of vinegar, one of water, one
spoonful of butter, and one teaspoonful of soda dissolved
in a little hot water. Boil all together without
stirring, for half an hour. Flavor with lemon or vanilla.
This is very good when “pulled” like the old-fashioned
molasses candy, or it may be cooled on a buttered
plate.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO BLANCH ALMONDS</span></p>

<p>Pour boiling water on them and let them remain in
it a few minutes. Remove the skins, throw the almonds
into cold water, drain them from the water, but
do not wipe them.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">EVERTON TOFFY</span></p>

<p>In a shallow vessel, melt together one pound of
brown sugar and one-quarter of a pound of butter.
Stir well together for fifteen minutes, or until the mixture
becomes brittle when dropped in water. Lemon
or vanilla flavoring should be added before the cooking
is complete. Butter a flat plate, pour the toffy on it
to cool, and when partly cold, mark it off in squares
with a knife; it can then be easily broken.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">LEMON DROPS</span></p>

<p>Upon half a pound of finely powdered sugar pour
just enough lemon juice to dissolve it, and boil to the
consistency of thick syrup. Drop this in plates, and
put in a warm place to harden. Or pour four ounces
of lemon juice on one pound of loaf sugar, with four
ounces of rose water. Boil to a syrup, add grated
lemon peel and proceed as in the first recipe. By adding
raspberry syrup, instead of lemon juice, you have
raspberry drops.</p>

make into balls of the desired size.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">COCOANUT CANDY</span></p>

<p>Four cups of water, two and a half cups fine white

adhere to the finger; pour all into a pan slightly
dusted with powdered starch, and when cool divide
into small squares. Flavor to the taste, just before
pouring out to cool.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHOCOLATE CREAM DROPS</span></p>

<p>Mix one-half a cup of cream with two of white sugar,
boil and stir fully five minutes; set the dish into another
of cold water, and stir until it becomes hard;
then make into small balls about the size of marbles,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
and with a fork roll each one separately in the chocolate,
which has in the meantime been put in a bowl over
the boiling teakettle and melted. Put on brown paper
to cool. Flavor with vanilla, if desired. This amount
makes about fifty drops.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHOCOLATE CARAMELS</span></p>

<p>Two cups of sugar, one of molasses, one of milk, one
spoonful of butter, one of flour, and half a pound of
bakers’ chocolate. Butter your saucepan, put in the
sugar, molasses and milk, boil fifteen minutes; add
butter and flour, stirred to a cream, and boil five minutes
longer; then add the chocolate grated, and boil
until quite thick. Butter tin flat pans, and pour in the
mixture half an inch thick, and mark it in squares before
it gets hard.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHOCOLATE CARAMELS</span></p>

<p>One pint of new milk, quarter of a pound of grated
chocolate, and one cup and a half of white sugar. Boil
all these together until it will pull like candy; try a
little, and if stiff enough to pull, pour it on a buttered
dish, and mark it off in squares with a knife as it cools.
It will break easily when cold.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">CHOCOLATE KISSES</span></p>

<p>One-half pound of sugar, one ounce of finely-powdered
chocolate. Mix the sugar and chocolate together,
and then mix it with the whites of four eggs well
beaten. Drop on buttered paper, and bake.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">BOSTON CARAMELS</span></p>

<p>One pint bowl of bakers’ chocolate grated, two bowls
of yellow sugar, one bowl of New Orleans molasses,
one half a cup of milk, a piece of butter the size of a
small egg and vanilla flavoring; boil about twenty-five
minutes. It should not be so brittle as other candies.
Pour in buttered tins, and mark deeply with a
knife.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">KISSES, OR SUGAR DROPS</span></p>

<p>Rub to a cream half a cup of butter, with one cup of

on buttered tins, by the spoonful; let them be two
or three inches apart; sprinkle sugar over them and
bake quickly.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">SUGAR KISSES</span></p>

<p>Beat the whites of three eggs to a froth, then stir in
powdered white sugar, a little at a time, till you have
formed a very thick batter. Add two or three drops of
essence of lemon. Wet a sheet of white paper, lay it
on a tin and drop this mixture upon it in lumps about
the size and shape of a walnut. Set them in a cool
oven, and as soon as their surface is hardened, take
them out and remove them from the paper with a
broad-bladed knife. Let the oven cool still more, then
place these little cakes, laying the flat part of two together,
on a sieve and return them to the oven, where
they must remain for fifteen minutes before they are
done.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">THE SERVICE OF WINES</span></p>

<p>Cosmopolite Louisiana is undoubtedly the wine drinking
section of the Union, and a word as to the manner
of serving the wines which play no small part in the
discussion of “La Cuisine Creole,” will not be out of
place.</p>

<p>The inherited French taste of the greater portion of
the population, and the education by contact of the
American element, makes claret the universal table
wine. The climate, too, renders this wine particularly
palatable, and during the long heated term it is seldom
absent from the table of even the most economical. At
the restaurant it is the exception to see a person dining
without a bottle of <i lang="fr">vin ordinaire</i>, while for breakfast,
during hot weather, white wines of the lighter kinds
are much used.</p>

<p>As to the manner of serving wines at dinner the following
menu will convey the most adequate idea:</p>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>At large dinners in New Orleans a great deal of
wine is served, and you will be expected to drink with
your raw oysters, a light white wine; with soup and
hors d’œuvre, sherry or Madeira; with fish and entrees,
a heavy white wine; with releves and entremets,
a good claret followed by a <i lang="fr">Ponche Romaine</i>, which is
the turning point of the feast, or rest; after which will
be served with the roast, champagne; game and salad,
fine claret or burgundy, and with dessert cafe noir and
liqueurs.</p>

six courses at most—is given below. It is one which
has the endorsement of the best authorities:</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">GRAND BRULE A LA BOULANGER</span></p>

<p class="center">(<cite>From a Gourmet.</cite>)</p>

<p>The crowning of a grand dinner is a brule. It is the
<i lang="fr">piece de resistance</i>, the grandest <i lang="fr">pousse cafe</i> of all.
After the coffee has been served, the lights are turned
down or extinguished, brule is brought in and placed
in the centre of the table upon a pedestal surrounded
by flowers. A match is lighted, and after allowing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
sulphur to burn entirely off is applied to the brandy,
and as it burns it sheds its weird light upon the faces
of the company, making them appear like ghouls in
striking contrast to the gay surroundings. The stillness
that follows gives an opportunity for thoughts
that break out in ripples of laughter which pave the
way for the exhilaration that ensues.</p>

<p>Pour into a large silver bowl two wineglasses of best
French brandy, one half wineglass of kirsh, the same
of maraschino, and a small quantity of cinnamon and
allspice. Put in about ten cubes of white sugar; do not
crush them, but let them become saturated with the
liquor. Remove the lumps of sugar, place in a ladle
and cover with brandy. Ignite it as before directed,
then lift it with the contents from the bowl, but do not
mix. After it has burned about fifteen minutes serve
in wine glasses. The above is for five persons, and
should the company be larger add in proportion. Green
tea and champagne are sometimes added.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">PETIT BRULE</span></p>

<p>Take an ordinary-sized, thick-skinned orange; cut
through the peel entirely around the orange like the
line of the equator, then force off the peel by passing
the handle of a spoon between it and the pulp. Into
the cup thus formed put two lumps of sugar and some
cinnamon, and fill with fine French brandy (cognac),
and ignite it the same as the above and pour into
glasses. The brule will be found to have a pleasant
flavor given to it by the orange.</p>

out of the water, cut up the breasts in small pieces the
size of dice; fry a few pieces of onion without coloring
them, add a little flour and the water that the chickens
were boiled in, a little rice and the balance of the
chickens, meat and bones, chopped fine. Boil all together,
and when thoroughly cooked strain through a
colander and put back to boil, stirring constantly.
When it comes to a boil remove it from the fire and

fin to tail; put it in a pan, and moisten with white wine.
Add salt, pepper, parsley, six laurel leaves, some
thyme, sliced onions and three cloves; cover the head
with strips of bacon, and put it into the oven, covering
your fish-kettle with leaves of foolscap paper, and letting
it simmer for an hour. When about to serve, drain

forcemeat balls, or better, with pigeons a la Gautier,
iced (glaces) sweetbreads, small glaces, pope’s eyes of
a shoulder of veal, crabs, fowl livers, truffles, cock’s
combs and cock’s kidneys. Strain the sauce through a
silken sieve, and if not sufficiently seasoned, put into a
pan two spoonfuls of Spanish sauce, and two spoonfuls
of the dressing of your snapper; let it boil down one-half,
put your small garnishes into it, and pour the

allowing two or three heads to each person. Peel the
tails. Chop up a part of them, add to them some bread,
onions, salt, black pepper and an egg or two. With this
dressing, stuff the heads that you have cleaned out.
Chop the claws and the parts adhering to them. Fry
a little garlic, onions, ham, one turnip, one carrot, and
a little flour; add some water, the chopped claws, a few
tomatoes, thyme, sweet bay, parsley and a little rice
stirring often to avoid scorching. When well boiled,
strain through a colander. After straining, put back
to the fire and season to taste. Put the stuffed heads
into the oven until brown. When ready to serve, put
them and the tails in a soup dish and pour the soup

parsley, and half a bottle of white wine, and
enough water to cover the fish. Put it over a brisk fire

<p>Dress fourteen snipe, stuff them with a little
browned stuffing, to which add two hashed truffles.
Bend the skin back carefully while stuffing, and then
replace it so the birds will retain as nearly as possible
their natural appearance. Place the snipe so prepared
and larded with bacon, into a frying pan; and to
keep them sufficiently together in order that the skins
may not shrink much while cooking, put some strips of
bacon over them; moisten them with a little soup-stock,
cover them with buttered paper and let them
cook in the oven for forty minutes; then drain them,
lightly trim the lower side, and lay them on a little
mound of uncooked, but slightly browned stuffing,
breast up, in the bottom of a dish, and ice them
(glacez). Keep the dish hot in the oven for some minutes.
Remove the skin and eyes from the heads of the
snipe after cooking them and stick a small truffle in
each bill, and lay between each two birds, one of the
heads with the truffle up. Garnish the dish with stewed
cock’s combs, scallops, goose liver, and champignons;
add a little Madeira sauce, boiled down and permeated
with the flavor of the game. Ice (glacez) the
snipe and truffles, and serve with a separate sauce. Let
everything be very hot.</p>

pepper and vinegar; add a few cooked green peas,
mashed and well drained. Put all in a salad dish in

the form of a pyramid, and lightly cover it over with
mayonnaise. If you have the hearts of artichokes put

mixed in. Keep as cool as possible until served.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">BISCUIT GLACE FOR TWENTY</span></p>

<p>Ten yolks of eggs, one and a half pounds pulverized
sugar, half a gallon of cream, vanilla extract, white of
eggs well beaten if the cream is too light. To be frozen
in a square box and cut in small pieces. A coat of
strawberry sherbet on top of the cream, before cutting,
to give nice appearance. A tin box three inches wide
and six inches long, which is enclosed in a box three
inches larger all around. The inside box has a tight-fitting
top, and is packed in the outside box, which has
a perforated bottom to allow water or melted ice to
escape. Place inside box within the outer, and stuff
with ice and salt and let it freeze; when frozen, place
red sherbet on top of biscuit to give pretty appearance.

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="HINTS_ON_COOKING">HINTS ON COOKING</h2>
</div>
<hr class="medium">

<p>When salt hams or tongues are cooked they should
be instantly thrown into cold water, as the change from
the boiling water they were cooked in, to the cold
water, instantly loosens the skin from the flesh, and it
peels off without trouble.</p>

<p>Fresh vinegar should be added to chopped capers,
because it brings out their flavor, and makes the sauce
more appetizing.</p>

<p>Butter sauce should never be boiled, as it becomes
oily if boiled in making. The whites and yolks of eggs
should be beaten separately, because the tissues of
both can be better separated; and a tablespoonful of
water beaten with each is an improvement, and should
never be omitted.</p>

<p>Onions, turnips and carrots should be cut across the
fibre, as it makes them more tender when cooked.</p>

<p>Plenty of fast-boiling water should be used in cooking
vegetables, as the greater the volume of water the
greater the heat. If only a little water is used the
whole affair soon cools, the vegetables become tough,
and no length of time will render them tender.</p>

<p>In boiling greens, it is best to throw into them soda
with the salt, as the soda extracts the oil in them
which is injurious to the digestion; from one-half to a
whole teaspoonful of soda for a pot of greens is the
right quantity.</p>

<p>Parsley should never be boiled in soda, but in boiling
water and salt; boil from one to two minutes, and then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
chop fine. Use plenty of water to boil parsley, as a little
water toughens it, and turns it brown.</p>

<p>Never soak dried beans in cold water as it extracts
the nutritious portion of the bean. They should be
washed first in warm water, then in cold, tied in a cloth
and dropped into boiling water, with a little salt in it
and be kept boiling for four hours. Then they are nice
baked around pork, or served with gravy. To make a
puree of them you throw them when boiled, into cold
water, when the skins will drop off easily, and you can
mash them through a sieve or colander and season
with butter, pepper, and salt.</p>

<p>Open the oven door, when baking meat, to let off the
burnt, scorched air. The oven should be very hot, and
the meat well larded, or covered with fat, or dripping,
then well floured; this keeps in the juices and renders
the meat tender.</p>

<p>House cleaning should commence at the top of the
house and work downwards. In this case it may be
undertaken by spells, with intervening rests.</p>

<p>After the floors are cleaned, the walls and ceilings
claim attention.</p>

<p>A very beautiful whitening for walls and ceilings
may be made by shaking the best lime in hot water,
covering up to keep in the steam, and straining the
milk of lime through a fine sieve; add to a pailful half
a pound of common alum, two pounds of sugar, three
pints of rice-flour made into a thin, well-boiled paste,
and one pound of white glue dissolved slowly over the
fire. It should be applied with a paint-brush when
warm.</p>

<p>Paint should be cleaned by using only a little water
at a time and changing often; a soft flannel cloth or
sponge is better than cotton or a brush; a piece of pine
wood with a sharp point should be used for the corners.
Where the paint is stained with smoke, some
ashes or potash lye may be used. A soft linen towel
should be used for wiping dry. Glass should not be
cleaned with soap; a little paste of whiting and water
should be rubbed over, and with another cloth it should
be rinsed off, and the glass polished with a soft linen or
old silk handkerchief. Alcohol or benzine is a good
thing to clean glass, and clean paper is probably better
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
than any cloth, sponge or towel; dry paper leaves an
excellent polish. Marble may be cleaned with a mixture
of two parts of common soda, one part of pumice
stone, and one of chalk, finely powdered and tied up in
a fine muslin rag; the marble is wetted with water, the
powder shaken over it, and it is rubbed with a soft
cloth until clean, then washed in clean water and dried
with a soft linen or silk handkerchief. No soap or
potash should be allowed on marble. A good furniture
polish is made by melting two ounces of beeswax, one
ounce of turpentine, and one dram of powdered rosin
together, with a gentle heat, and rubbing on when cold,
with a soft flannel cloth, and polishing with a soft
linen or silk cloth. If for mahogany, a little Indian
red may be used. Cracks in furniture may be filled
with putty, mixed with Indian-red or burnt umber, to
get the desired shade. When dry it will take an equal
polish with the wood.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">HARD SOAP FOR HOUSEHOLD PURPOSES. AGREEABLE AND
CLEAN</span></p>

<p>To seven pound of tallow, or other clean grease, use
three pounds of rosin, add six gallons of water to this,
and stir in two pounds of potash; boil this together for
five hours, then turn the soap, while hot, into a washtub
and let it stay all night; when cool cut into bars,
and lay on a board to harden. This quantity should
be sufficient for a family of four persons for one year.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">WASHING MIXTURE</span></p>

<p>An excellent and harmless washing mixture may be
made by cutting up a large bar of soap and dissolving
it with two ounces of borax in a half gallon of water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
Boil the mixture till the soap is soft, and put it away
to be used when required. There is nothing in it to
take the color out of goods, and it saves labor and soap.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">FRUIT STAINS</span></p>

<p>Fruit stains may often be removed from clothing by
plunging the latter into boiling water, letting it remain
immersed for a few minutes, and then washing it out
in the ordinary way.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">TO PREVENT GOODS FROM FADING</span></p>

<p>Drop into a pail of water a teaspoonful of sugar of
lead, and let it dissolve. Soak the goods in this mixture
for half an hour before washing them in the ordinary
manner.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="allsmcap">IVIES FOR INSIDE DECORATIONS</span></p>

<p>It is not generally known that the various evergreen
ivies will grow and flourish to perfection in the shade,
and that, therefore, any room may be most charmingly
decorated with them. Such is the fact, however. Put
the plants in large pots, filled with rich and mellow
garden soil kept at a suitable regulation of moisture;
and you will have no trouble about the matter. The
vines may be trained on wire trellises fastened to the
wall or ceiling; or upon any other convenient arrangement.
In a treatise on this subject the <cite>Rural
New Yorker</cite> says:</p>

<p>“It may also be stated that the room decorated with
ivy should not be kept too warm, but at a moderate
temperature; such as is most healthful for a person
is the best. No one need to fear to make the room unhealthy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
by introducing the ivy in abundance; for plants
purify the air, and it is only when we introduce those
emitting strong odors that anything but beneficial effects
result. As all ivies succeed well in the shade,
they are more suitable for the purpose herein designated
than almost any other kind of plant.</p>

<p>“There is also another plant largely used for this
purpose, which is not a true ivy, although known as
German ivy (<i lang="la">Senecio scandens</i>). It grows even more
rapidly than any of the true ivies (<i lang="la">Hedera</i>), and we
have seen a small plant grow so fast that it encircled
quite a large room in a few weeks. It thrives well in
the shade, and the leaves resemble somewhat the common
English ivy, but are of a lighter and more cheerful
green color. This and a great variety of ivies are
grown for sale by our florists.”
